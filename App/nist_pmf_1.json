Information about data processing and resulting privacy risks is shared within the organization on an informal basis. Consideration of privacy in organizational objectives and programs may occur at some but not all levels of the organization. Privacy risk assessment occurs, but is not typically repeatable or reoccurring. \u2022 Data Processing Ecosystem Relationships \u2013 There is some understanding of an organization\u2019s role(s) in the larger ecosystem with respect to other entities (e.g., buyers, suppliers, service providers, business associates, partners). The organization is aware of the privacy ecosystem risks associated with the products and services it provides and uses, but does not act consistently or formally upon those risks. \u2022 Workforce \u2013 There are personnel with specific privacy responsibilities, but they may have non-privacy responsibilities as well. Privacy training is conducted regularly for privacy personnel, although there is no consistent process for updates on best practices.",
