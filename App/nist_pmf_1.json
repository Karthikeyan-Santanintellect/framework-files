Through a process of continuous improvement incorporating advanced privacy technologies and practices, the organization actively adapts to a changing policy and technology landscape and responds in a timely and effective manner to evolving privacy risks. \u2022 Integrated Privacy Risk Management Program \u2013 There is an organization-wide approach to managing privacy risk that uses risk-informed policies, processes, and procedures to address problematic data actions. The relationship between privacy risk and organizational objectives is clearly understood and considered when making decisions. Senior executives monitor privacy risk in the same context as cybersecurity risk, financial risk, and other organizational risks. The organizational budget is based on an understanding of the current and predicted risk environment and risk tolerance. Business units implement executive vision and analyze system-level risks in the context of the organizational risk tolerances. Privacy risk management is part of the organizational culture and evolves from lessons learned and continuous awareness of data processing and resulting privacy risks. The organization can quickly and efficiently account for changes to business/mission objectives in how risk is approached and communicated. \u2022 Data Processing Ecosystem Relationships \u2013 The organization understands its role(s), dependencies, and dependents in the larger ecosystem and contributes to the community's broader understanding of risks. The organization uses real-time or near-real-time information to understand and consistently act upon privacy ecosystem risks associated with the products and services it provides and it uses. Additionally, it communicates proactively, using formal (e.g., agreements) and informal mechanisms to develop and maintain strong ecosystem relationships. \u2022 Workforce \u2013 The organization has specialized privacy skillsets throughout the organizational structure; personnel with diverse perspectives contribute to the management of privacy risks. There is regular, up-to-date, specialized privacy training for all personnel. Personnel at all levels understand the organizational privacy values and their role in maintaining them.",
