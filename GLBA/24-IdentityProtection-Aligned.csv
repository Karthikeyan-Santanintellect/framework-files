glba_id_001,"Identity Theft Risk Management and Red Flags Integration","Procedure","Enterprise approach for identifying, assessing, and managing identity-theft risks across products and channels, integrating GLBA safeguards with the Identity Theft Red Flags Rule and related regulations.","Identity-theft risk management under GLBA requires institutions to identify reasonably foreseeable risks to customer information and accounts, implement controls to prevent and detect identity-theft incidents, and coordinate with the Identity Theft Red Flags Rule issued under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. A mature program maps identity-theft risks by product, channel, and customer segment and uses layered controls such as strong customer identification and authentication, anomaly detection, transaction-monitoring rules, velocity checks, out-of-wallet questions, device fingerprinting, and robust customer communications. Written red-flags programs define specific patterns, such as address mismatches, unusual login behavior, sudden card-not-present activity, or alerts from credit bureaus, that trigger investigation and potential protective actions.","All GLBA-covered institutions that offer consumer or small-business accounts exposed to identity-theft risk, including banks, credit unions, credit-card issuers, mortgage and auto lenders, and certain non-bank financial institutions.","Chief Risk Officer for enterprise oversight; Chief Information Security Officer and Fraud or AML leaders for technical controls and monitoring; business-line heads for product-specific implementations; Compliance for regulatory interpretation; Internal Audit for independent validation.","GLBA Section 501 safeguarding obligations; FTC Safeguards Rule; Identity Theft Red Flags Rule adopted by the federal banking agencies and FTC under FACTA; BSA or AML suspicious-activity requirements; FFIEC guidance on authentication and fraud; state identity-theft and data-breach statutes.","Critical component of consumer protection. Examiners assess whether institutions have a coherent, well-documented identity-theft risk program integrated with GLBA safeguards, Red Flags, authentication controls, and fraud-management practices.","Risk Assessment: inventory products and channels where identity-theft risk is material, including online account opening, remote deposit capture, P2P or faster payments, wires, and card-not-present channels; analyze historical losses and emerging schemes such as account-takeover and synthetic identities. Governance: establish a cross-functional steering committee linking fraud, security, AML, digital, operations, and compliance; define risk appetite; approve metrics and escalation thresholds. Red Flags Program: adopt a written Identity Theft Red Flags Program that lists relevant red flags, assigns ownership for detection, and prescribes responses ranging from enhanced verification to account holds and law-enforcement referrals; review and update at least annually. Control Design: deploy layered controls including robust KYC at onboarding, adaptive authentication and multi-factor authentication for high-risk actions, behavioral analytics and device intelligence, and proactive outreach when anomalies are detected. Customer Education: provide clear guidance on phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and safe use of online and mobile banking; publish FAQs and alerts when new scams appear. Metrics and Reporting: track key indicators such as fraud-loss ratios, account-takeover attempts, successful compromises, detection times, and false-positive rates; report trends to senior management and the board with recommended control enhancements." 
glba_id_002,"Identity Theft Incident Handling and Customer Protection","Procedure","Standardized end-to-end response when identity theft is suspected or confirmed, including account protection, investigation, remediation, and customer communications.","When identity theft is suspected through alerts, customer complaints, law-enforcement referrals, or monitoring systems, institutions must act quickly to contain harm, protect affected customers, and meet GLBA and other regulatory obligations. A formal incident-handling playbook covers triage and verification, immediate protective actions such as placing holds or closing compromised accounts, investigation of root cause, and restoration of legitimate customer access. It coordinates with the broader information-security incident-response plan and BSA or AML processes for suspicious-activity reporting. Customer-facing elements include clear instructions for reporting fraud, assistance in disputing unauthorized transactions, guidance on credit-bureau alerts and freezes, and timely, transparent communication on what happened and what the institution is doing.","All GLBA-covered institutions, particularly those offering consumer deposit accounts, payment cards, lending products, and digital-banking platforms.","Fraud Management and Operations for frontline handling; contact centers and branches for intake and communication; Information Security for technical investigation when systems or credentials are compromised; BSA or AML for SAR decisioning; Compliance and Legal for regulatory analysis and disclosure obligations.","GLBA Safeguards Rule; GLBA breach-notification expectations when identity-theft incidents stem from security events; FACTA identity-theft provisions; Regulation E and Regulation Z for liability and dispute rights on unauthorized transactions; FCRA and state identity-theft and data-breach laws.","Key measure of consumer-protection effectiveness. Supervisors expect documented, consistently executed identity-theft response processes that provide strong protections and honor legal rights and timelines.","Detection and Intake: provide multiple intake channels such as phone, branch, secure message, and web forms; train staff to recognize common identity-theft indicators including customer reports of unfamiliar accounts or transactions, returned mail, credit-bureau alerts, and law-enforcement notices. Triage and Verification: authenticate the customer using strong methods; confirm the nature and extent of unauthorized activity; identify whether other accounts or channels may be compromised. Immediate Protective Measures: place temporary holds on at-risk accounts, close and reissue cards or account numbers, force password resets and enable MFA, adjust limits, and add enhanced monitoring rules. Investigation and Root Cause: analyze transactional patterns, device fingerprints, login history, and contact-center logs to determine how the compromise occurred and whether it is part of a broader breach; document findings. Customer Remediation: credit or reverse unauthorized electronic-funds transfers and card charges consistent with Reg E and Reg Z timelines; waive related fees; support customers in updating direct deposits and payment instructions on new accounts. External Coordination: assist customers in placing fraud alerts or credit freezes at credit bureaus; encourage filing of police reports where appropriate; cooperate with law-enforcement investigations. Documentation and Reporting: log incidents in a centralized case-management system; record amounts at risk and recovered, customer communications, control weaknesses, and final disposition; determine whether SARs or data-breach notifications are required; periodically analyze incident data to refine controls." 
glba_id_003,"Identity Protection Services, Notifications, and Credit-Monitoring","Procedure","Framework for when and how to provide identity-protection services such as credit-monitoring, dark-web monitoring, or restoration support after GLBA-relevant incidents, and how to manage related vendors and notifications.","In data-breach and identity-theft contexts, regulators and customers increasingly expect institutions to offer appropriate identity-protection services, especially when sensitive identifiers such as Social Security numbers or full account credentials are compromised. A GLBA-aligned approach defines risk-based criteria for offering services, selects and oversees vendors that provide credit-monitoring and identity-restoration support, and standardizes customer notifications and enrollment processes. Identity-protection offerings must be integrated into incident-response plans, structured so that they do not become marketing channels, and monitored for effectiveness and customer satisfaction.","Institutions that maintain or process sensitive personal identifiers or authentication credentials for consumers and may need to remediate identity-theft or data-breach impacts.","Information Security and incident-response leaders for breach assessment; Legal and Compliance for regulatory expectations and liability analysis; Procurement and Vendor Management for selection and oversight of identity-protection vendors; customer-experience and communications teams for notification design and support.","GLBA Safeguards and breach-notification guidance; FTC guidance and consent orders on breach remediation and identity-protection practices; state data-breach statutes that recommend or require mitigation services; FCRA and credit-bureau rules governing fraud alerts and credit freezes.","Best practice and, in some severe incidents, a de facto regulatory expectation. Enforcement staff often evaluate whether offered protections were appropriate to the risk and clearly communicated.","Risk-Based Triggers: define specific thresholds, such as compromise of Social Security numbers, government-ID numbers, or full authentication credentials, at which the institution will generally offer credit-monitoring or identity-protection services; consider heightened protections for vulnerable populations. Vendor Selection and Oversight: conduct due diligence on potential vendors, including security posture, service scope, regulatory history, geographic and language coverage, and scalability; negotiate contracts that address GLBA safeguard obligations, strict limits on vendor data use, notification of vendor-side incidents, service-level targets, and audit rights; monitor enrollment rates, call-center quality, and complaint patterns. Service Design: determine which services to provide such as single- or triple-bureau monitoring, dark-web monitoring, identity-restoration assistance, and optional identity-theft insurance; set standard service durations such as 12 or 24 months for significant breaches; ensure that enrollment does not require acceptance of unrelated marketing. Customer Notifications: prepare clear, jargon-free templates explaining what happened, what data was affected, what the institution has done, and what identity-protection services are available; include step-by-step enrollment instructions and practical advice for monitoring accounts and reports. Integration with Incident Response: embed identity-protection decision points in incident-response runbooks so that offers can be approved and launched quickly; coordinate with regulators when notification content or mitigation scope may be scrutinized. Measurement and Improvement: track uptake rates, subsequent fraud among affected individuals, and customer-satisfaction feedback; periodically reassess vendor performance and adjust service offerings as threats and expectations evolve."
