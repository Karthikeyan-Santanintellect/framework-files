glba_bgcheck_001,"Background Check Service Provider Requirements","Procedure","Requirements for third-party background-check agencies that provide screening services to financial institutions, including FCRA compliance, GLBA safeguards, data security, and accuracy obligations.","Financial institutions frequently rely on external background-check agencies, also called consumer reporting agencies, to screen employees, contractors, and in some cases vendors or other insiders. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act these agencies must follow strict procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy, handle disputes, and limit use and disclosure of reports. Under GLBA they are also treated as service providers handling sensitive personal information and must maintain appropriate safeguards. Institutions are responsible for selecting reputable agencies, contractually requiring them to comply with FCRA and GLBA, and monitoring their performance. A robust framework covers vendor due diligence, contract clauses, information-security expectations, breach-notification duties, and periodic quality reviews.","Any GLBA-covered financial institution that outsources pre-employment or ongoing screening of employees, contractors, or third-party personnel to external consumer-reporting or investigative-reporting firms.","Human Resources for day-to-day ordering and use of reports; Procurement or Vendor Management for due diligence and contracting; Compliance and Legal for interpretation of FCRA and GLBA obligations; Information Security for assessing technical controls; Internal Audit for periodic, independent review.","Fair Credit Reporting Act and implementing regulations; GLBA Safeguards Rule and service-provider provisions; FTC guidance on employment background checks; state background-check and privacy laws; internal vendor-management policies.","Mandatory when using external agencies. Examiners may review how institutions oversee background-check vendors, including contract terms, security practices, and complaint or dispute handling.","Vendor Due Diligence: verify that the agency is a legitimate consumer-reporting organization with appropriate licensing or registrations; review regulatory-enforcement history and litigation; check references from other financial institutions; assess ownership structure and financial stability. Security Assessment: evaluate the agency's information-security program, including encryption of data in transit and at rest, authentication and access control, employee screening and training, incident-response capabilities, and independent assurance such as SOC 2 or ISO certifications. Contract Requirements: require written commitments to comply with FCRA and GLBA; specify detailed data-security standards, breach-notification timelines, audit and inspection rights, data-use limitations, subcontractor controls, and data-retention and destruction obligations. Performance Monitoring: track turnaround times, rate of errors and disputes, and user complaints; require root-cause analysis and corrective-action plans where weaknesses are identified; consider alternative vendors if performance is persistently poor. Exit Strategy: define how data will be returned or destroyed at the end of the relationship; require certification of destruction; ensure continuing confidentiality obligations after termination." 
glba_bgcheck_002,"Applicant Privacy Rights and FCRA or GLBA Compliance","Procedure","Procedures to protect applicant privacy and legal rights when background checks are used for hiring or employment decisions, combining FCRA requirements with GLBA confidentiality obligations.","When institutions use consumer reports for employment purposes, the FCRA grants applicants and employees specific rights and GLBA adds overarching obligations to safeguard personal information and limit disclosure. Applicants must receive a clear, standalone disclosure that a report may be obtained, must provide written authorization, must receive a copy of the report and a summary of rights before any adverse action is taken, and must have an opportunity to dispute inaccurate information. A compliant process standardizes disclosure and authorization forms, adverse-action workflows, dispute handling, access controls, and recordkeeping while minimizing unnecessary data collection and restricting access to those with a need to know.","All applicants, employees, contractors, and where applicable volunteers who are subject to background screening by a GLBA-covered financial institution.","Human Resources for execution of the process; Compliance and Legal for policy design and oversight; hiring managers for decision-making; Information Security for secure handling and storage of reports; Records Management for retention and destruction.","FCRA provisions on employment background checks; FTC guidance on pre-adverse and adverse action; GLBA Privacy and Safeguards requirements; EEOC guidance on use of criminal and credit history in employment; state-law supplements such as ban-the-box rules and enhanced notice requirements.","Mandatory where consumer reports are used. Examiners and regulators often scrutinize FCRA workflows, and plaintiffs' lawyers frequently challenge technical non-compliance, so documentation and consistency are critical.","Disclosure and Authorization: provide a written, standalone disclosure that clearly states a consumer report may be obtained for employment purposes; obtain signed and dated authorization separately from the job application; avoid combining waivers or extraneous language that could confuse applicants. Pre-Adverse Action: if the institution is inclined to take an adverse action based in whole or in part on the report, first provide the individual with a copy of the report and the FCRA summary of rights and allow a reasonable period for review and response. Adverse Action: after the waiting period, if the decision is finalized, send a written adverse-action notice that identifies the consumer-reporting agency, states that the agency did not make the decision and cannot explain it, and reiterates the right to dispute and to obtain an additional free report. Dispute Handling: create procedures for receiving disputes, forwarding them promptly to the reporting agency, tracking reinvestigation outcomes, and reassessing employment decisions when corrections occur; document timelines and results. Confidentiality and Minimization: restrict access to reports to HR, Legal, and managers with a legitimate need; avoid unnecessary printing or unencrypted emailing; store reports in secure systems and destroy them after defined retention periods. Training: train HR staff and hiring managers at least annually on FCRA and GLBA obligations, non-discrimination principles, and the importance of consistent application of screening criteria." 
glba_bgcheck_003,"Applicant Data Security, Retention, and Destruction","Procedure","Controls to protect the security and confidentiality of applicant data collected during background-check processes, define retention periods, and ensure secure destruction once information is no longer needed.","Background-check processes generate and store highly sensitive personal information, including full names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, addresses, employment and education histories, criminal-record data, and sometimes credit information. Under the GLBA Safeguards Rule and state laws, institutions must protect this information from unauthorized access or misuse, ensure it is retained only as long as necessary for legal and business purposes, and then destroy it securely. Effective control frameworks combine technical safeguards such as encryption, access control, and monitoring; administrative measures such as policies, training, and approvals; and physical protections such as secure storage for any paper records. They also address how third-party vendors store, transmit, and dispose of data.","All applicant and employee background-check files created or maintained by GLBA-covered institutions, whether checks are performed internally or through third-party vendors.","Information Security for technical safeguards; Human Resources and Records Management for retention rules, storage, and destruction; Compliance and Legal for policy-setting and legal-hold guidance; Vendor Management for oversight of third-party storage and destruction.","GLBA Safeguards Rule and disposal provisions; FCRA expectations for data accuracy and confidentiality; state data-breach and secure-disposal statutes; internal information-security and records-retention policies.","Mandatory component of the institution's information-security program. Regulators and auditors expect documented retention schedules, evidence of secure destruction, and vendor-oversight artifacts for background-check data.","Data Classification and Inventory: classify background-check information as highly sensitive; maintain an inventory of systems, applications, and repositories where this data resides, such as HR systems, vendor portals, shared drives, and email. Access Controls: enforce least-privilege access; use strong authentication, including multi-factor authentication where feasible; review access rights regularly and promptly revoke access when roles change. Encryption and Transmission Security: encrypt data at rest and in transit; require secure channels such as HTTPS or SFTP when exchanging data with vendors; prohibit movement of background-check files via personal email or unencrypted removable media. Retention Schedules: define retention periods for unsuccessful applicants, successful candidates, and terminated employees that balance legal requirements with privacy considerations; document schedules and review them periodically with Legal. Secure Destruction: use shredding, pulping, or incineration for paper files; use secure-erase tools or certified media-destruction services for electronic data; obtain certificates of destruction from vendors; record destruction events. Legal Holds: implement mechanisms to suspend destruction when litigation or investigations require preservation; clearly flag and protect records under hold. Monitoring and Incident Response: periodically test controls such as access reviews and destruction sampling; include applicant-data scenarios in the enterprise incident-response plan; if breaches occur, investigate root cause, notify affected individuals and regulators as required, and remediate weaknesses."
