glba_inc_001,Security Incident,Event,"Unauthorized access to, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction of customer information or information systems. Security incident reportable under GLBA breach notification requirements if affects 500+ individuals or per state law thresholds. Incident discovery triggers FTC notification requirement (30-day deadline for breaches affecting 500+).","Per GLBA Safeguards Rule Element 8 (16 CFR 314.4(e)) and Breach Notification Rule (16 CFR 314.5), security incident is confirmed or suspected security event involving customer information that creates risk of harm. Security incident definition encompasses: data breach (unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of data); system compromise (malware, ransomware, unauthorized access to systems); hacking incidents (external intrusion); insider threats (employee/contractor unauthorized access); data destruction (ransomware, intentional deletion); data exfiltration (large unauthorized data downloads); payment fraud (unauthorized transactions); account takeover (unauthorized account access); phishing attacks affecting staff; physical theft of devices/media. Incident vs. non-incident: incident = confirmed unauthorized access/compromise; suspicious activity not yet confirmed may be investigated as potential incident; false alarms = not incidents if no actual compromise; near-misses = educational value but not incidents. Incident discovery: point at which institution becomes aware of incident; not incident date but awareness date determines breach notification timeline (30-day deadline from discovery). Incident scope: impacts on customer information; number of individuals affected; type of information exposed; impacts on systems; ransomware ransom demand. Incident severity: low (limited data, limited individuals); medium (moderate data/scope); high (significant data/many individuals); critical (large breach, payment systems compromise, widespread system compromise). Incident response triggers: formal incident investigation; containment procedures; notification procedures; law enforcement notification (if appropriate); FTC notification (if 500+ individuals affected); state consumer notification; regulatory notification; reporting to board.","All financial institutions; all information systems; all locations; all data types (customer information, internal systems, payment systems, email);

glba_inc_002,Breach of Customer Information,Event,"Unauthorized access to, use, or disclosure of customer (nonpublic personal information) causing substantial risk of identity theft or fraud. Breach triggering FTC notification requirement (30-day deadline) if 500+ individuals affected, and state consumer notification requirement based on state law thresholds (varies from any to 500+ individuals).","Per GLBA Safeguards Rule 16 CFR 314.5 (Breach Notification Rule effective May 13, 2024) and FTC enforcement authority, breach of customer information is specific type of security incident involving unauthorized disclosure of nonpublic personal information that creates risk of harm. Breach definition: unauthorized access to, use, or disclosure of customer information that creates substantial risk of identity theft or fraud. Breach vs. unauthorized access: breach = access creates risk of harm; just unauthorized access alone may not be breach if data not sensitive; access to financial account numbers = likely breach; access to non-sensitive data = may not breach if no harm risk. Risk assessment required: institution must assess whether unauthorized access creates substantial risk of identity theft or fraud. Breach notification rule (16 CFR 314.5) requires: financial institution notify affected individuals without unreasonable delay but no later than 60 calendar days after discovery; notify FTC within 30 calendar days of discovery if breach affects 500+ consumers; notify state attorney general within 30 days if affects 500+ state residents. FTC notification method: online Security Event Reporting Form at identitytheft.gov; form includes: date of discovery, date of filing, number of affected individuals, states of residence, types of data, incident description. State requirements: vary by state; some require notification of any individual affected; some require 500+ threshold; institution must comply with most stringent; notice to state AG required in many states. Breach notification content: required information: type of customer information involved; brief description of incident; steps consumers should take; institution contact information; optional but recommended: institution's response; credit monitoring offer; fraud monitoring tips. Credentialing information breaches: Social Security numbers, financial account numbers (with access credentials), payment card numbers (with security code) = high risk of identity theft/fraud; typically trigger notification. Health information: medical records, prescription information = sensitive; typically trigger notification. Financial information: account balances, transaction history = sensitive; typically trigger notification. Personal identifiers without financial data: name, address, phone number, email alone = lower risk; may not trigger notification if no financial info. Sensitive health or financial data: combination significantly increases harm risk. Risk factors: what was exposed; how many individuals; how long exposed; whether data already exposed/sold; evidence of misuse; Notification Timing: 30-day FTC notification deadline: starts from discovery date; not investigation completion; even if investigation ongoing, notify within 30 days; initial notification acceptable if scope estimated; update FTC if scope changes. 60-day consumer notification deadline: per rule (varies by state); typical practice: as soon as reasonably possible after discovery; notification methods: U.S. mail (primary); email if consent; publicize if 500+ individuals affected. Substantial Risk Assessment: institution must assess whether unauthorized access creates substantial risk of identity theft or fraud. Factors: nature of data breached; whether data accessed/viewed/taken; evidence of misuse; time between breach and discovery; security breaches of similar data elsewhere in industry; Security Event Reporting: FTC portal: identitytheft.gov/bcp/consumer/articles/identity-theft-7-steps-to-protect-yourself-after-identity-theft; online form submission; form fields: (1) name and address of entity; (2) contact person and phone; (3) date of discovery; (4) number of affected individuals; (5) states represented; (6) brief description of event; (7) types of information involved. Multiple Filings: if affected individuals in multiple states and multi-state notification required, FTC notification covers all states. Supplemental Filing: if scope changes after initial filing, may file supplement with updated numbers. No Charge: FTC notification free; no fees. Streamlined Process: form-based system designed for easy reporting. Confidentiality: reporting information not public (varies by state); initial reports may be confidential; public if enforcement action. Breach Notice Content: must disclose clearly and without unreasonable delay; required elements: (1) description of what occurred (e.g., 'unauthorized access to our systems'); (2) customer information involved (e.g., 'names and Social Security numbers'); (3) steps customers should take (monitor accounts, fraud alerts, credit report check, credit freeze); (4) institution contact information and phone; (5) availability of credit monitoring or fraud alert service. Formatting: must be clear; readable; plain language; accessible. Breach Determination Factors: unauthorized access alone insufficient; must create substantial risk of identity theft or fraud. Factors: (1) nature of information (financial data more sensitive); (2) unauthorized disclosure (access not taken = lower risk); (3) evidence of misuse or exposure to third parties; (4) timing (quicker discovery = lower risk); (5) controls in place (encryption = lower risk); (6) similar breaches in industry. Vendor Breach: if service provider breached and accessed customer information, institution must notify; service provider failure does not eliminate notification obligation; institution liable for notification. Forensic Investigation: institution typically conducts forensic investigation to: confirm breach; determine scope; identify cause; remediation steps; preserve evidence; support notification. Costs of Breach: notification costs; credit monitoring; forensic investigation; law enforcement cooperation; regulatory penalties; reputational damage. Credit Monitoring Offer: if breach involves SSN, financial account numbers, payment card data with security code: recommend offering credit monitoring; fraud alert services; free credit report access; credit freeze support. Cyber Insurance: cyber liability insurance may cover: investigation costs; notification costs; credit monitoring; regulatory fines (some policies); defense costs; claim value depends on policy. Regulatory Implications: GLBA Safeguards Rule violation; may trigger: FTC enforcement action; banking regulator enforcement action; civil penalties; consumer lawsuits; state attorney general enforcement; Board Reporting: board must be informed of breach; incident response; notification plans; remediation; regulatory exposure. Customer Communication: affected customers notified of breach; offer of remediation; brand protection; trust maintenance. Post-Breach Actions: improve security; patch vulnerabilities; enhance monitoring; employee training; vendor assessment; process improvements"
