ti_prov_001,"Threat Intelligence Provider Definition and Scope","Definition","Definition and scoping framework for external and internal threat-intelligence providers that support GLBA security and fraud-prevention programs.","Threat-intelligence providers collect, analyze, and distribute information about cyber, fraud, and physical threats that may affect financial institutions and their customers. In the GLBA context, threat intelligence supports the requirement to identify reasonably foreseeable internal and external threats to customer information and to adjust safeguards accordingly. Providers can include commercial vendors, industry information-sharing organizations, government programs, card networks, and internal analytics teams. Clear scoping of what types of indicators, reports, and alerts are expected from each provider enables institutions to integrate this intelligence into risk assessments, monitoring systems, and incident response.","All GLBA-covered institutions that use external or internal intelligence sources to inform cybersecurity, fraud, anti-money-laundering, and physical-security controls.","Chief Information Security Officer and Cybersecurity teams for cyber-threat intelligence; Fraud and AML leaders for fraud and financial-crime intelligence; Third-Party Risk Management for vendor oversight; Legal and Compliance for information-sharing rules.","GLBA Safeguards Rule requirement to identify reasonably foreseeable threats; FFIEC Cybersecurity Assessment Tool and Information Security booklets; FS-ISAC and other sector information-sharing frameworks; relevant information-sharing and safe-harbor provisions (for example, USA PATRIOT Act Section 314(b) for certain financial-crime sharing).","Foundational for proactive, intelligence-driven GLBA safeguard programs.","Provider Types: categorize providers as commercial threat-intelligence platforms, managed-security-service providers, card-network bulletins, government feeds, industry ISACs, and internal analytics units; document scope and contact points for each. Intelligence Domains: define which domains are covered, including malware, phishing, ransomware, account-takeover, insider threats, third-party risks, physical threats, and regulatory changes. Data Types: identify the types of data received, such as indicators of compromise (IP addresses, domains, file hashes), TTP (tactics, techniques, and procedures) reports, strategic threat assessments, and sector-specific alerts. Use Cases: map each provider to use cases like security monitoring enrichment, fraud-rule tuning, vulnerability management, risk assessments, and incident-response support. Coverage Gaps: periodically review whether additional providers or information-sharing relationships are needed to cover emerging threats or geographic expansion." 
ti_prov_002,"Integration of Threat Intelligence into GLBA Safeguards","Procedure","Processes for integrating threat intelligence into risk assessment, control design, monitoring, and incident response for GLBA-regulated data.","Threat intelligence has value only if it meaningfully influences controls and decisions. For GLBA Safeguards compliance, institutions must show how intelligence about new attack methods, vulnerabilities, and fraud schemes feeds into risk assessments and control changes. This includes enriching security-monitoring systems with current indicators, updating phishing filters and fraud-detection rules, prioritizing patching based on exploit activity, and incorporating new scenarios into incident-response and business-continuity plans. Integration also extends to vendor and third-party risk, where intelligence may reveal issues at key providers handling customer information.","All security, fraud, and risk-management functions that use intelligence to design or adjust controls protecting customer information and related systems.","Cybersecurity Operations and SOC for monitoring use cases; Vulnerability Management for patch prioritization; Fraud and AML teams for rule tuning and case triage; Enterprise Risk Management and Compliance for updating risk assessments and control libraries.","GLBA Safeguards Rule; FFIEC guidance on threat intelligence and cybersecurity; NIST-based frameworks used internally; third-party risk-management guidelines.","Demonstrates that intelligence is operationalized, not merely collected, which is a key expectation in mature GLBA programs.","Risk Assessment Updates: use intelligence about new exploits, targeting patterns, and sector incidents to update risk assessments for systems holding customer data; document changes in likelihood or impact ratings. Monitoring Enrichment: feed indicators of compromise and fraud patterns into SIEM, IDS/IPS, email filters, web filters, and fraud-detection engines; validate that new rules trigger as expected and do not generate excessive false positives. Vulnerability and Patch Management: prioritize remediation of vulnerabilities that are actively exploited in the wild or known to be used against financial institutions; tie intelligence feeds to vulnerability-scanning outputs. Scenario Planning and Exercises: incorporate current threat scenarios into tabletop exercises and simulations, such as ransomware attacking core systems or targeted spear-phishing of high-value staff; adjust incident-response runbooks based on exercise outcomes. Third-Party Oversight: use intelligence to inform risk ratings for critical vendors, especially cloud providers and processors; monitor for news of breaches or vulnerabilities at providers and require remediation or contract adjustments when warranted. Documentation: record how specific intelligence items influenced control changes, risk ratings, or incident-response decisions, so that examiners can trace the linkage." 
ti_prov_003,"Governance, Contracts, and Information-Sharing Compliance for Threat Intelligence Providers","Procedure","Governance, contractual, and compliance framework for managing relationships with threat-intelligence providers and sharing information in a GLBA-consistent manner.","Threat-intelligence relationships themselves create legal, privacy, and operational considerations. Contracts with commercial providers must address data rights, confidentiality, service levels, and security controls. Participation in information-sharing groups may involve sharing limited indicators or case details about attacks the institution has experienced. GLBA and other laws such as the Bank Secrecy Act and antitrust rules shape what and how institutions may share. A governance framework defines which teams can exchange what kinds of information, approval processes for new memberships or providers, and oversight of provider performance and security.","All relationships with external entities that provide or receive threat intelligence connected to the institution’s operations, including vendors, industry groups, and government programs.","Information Security Governance and Vendor Management for contracts and oversight; Legal and Compliance for information-sharing and confidentiality rules; Security Operations and Fraud teams as primary users and contributors of intelligence.","GLBA privacy and safeguard requirements; BSA/AML and USA PATRIOT Act information-sharing provisions; FS-ISAC governance frameworks; antitrust and information-sharing guidance; contractual best practices for data and security.","Ensures that threat-intelligence activities strengthen, rather than inadvertently weaken, the institution’s compliance and risk posture.","Contract Requirements: ensure contracts with commercial providers include confidentiality commitments, clear definitions of data ownership and usage rights, security controls for provider systems, uptime and delivery SLAs, and remedies for service failures or breaches. Data-Protection Expectations: require providers to safeguard any information about the institution’s systems, incidents, or customers that they may receive; align with GLBA service-provider obligations. Membership Governance: for ISACs and similar groups, define internal approval processes for joining, designate official points of contact, and document what categories of information may be shared under safe-harbor provisions. Sharing Protocols: establish guidelines for what indicators or anonymized information can be shared externally, ensuring that customer-identifying details and confidential business information are either removed or protected as allowed by law. Oversight and Metrics: periodically review provider performance, relevance of intelligence, incident support quality, and security posture; renew, expand, or terminate relationships based on risk and value. Training and Awareness: educate security and fraud staff on legal boundaries and obligations when sharing information; include examples of permissible and impermissible sharing and emphasize the need for coordination with Legal on sensitive cases."
