glba_ra_001,Risk Assessment,Process,"Periodic written evaluation of reasonably foreseeable internal and external risks to customer information security, confidentiality, integrity, and availability, with assessment of existing safeguard sufficiency, identification of gaps and weaknesses, and prioritization of risks for remediation. Foundation of information security program (Safeguards Rule Element 2).","Safeguards Rule 16 CFR 314.4(b) mandates periodic written risk assessment as foundational Element 2 of the information security program. Risk assessment must: (1) Identify reasonably foreseeable internal risks including insider threats, employee errors, system failures, process weaknesses, human mistakes, fraud by employees, negligence; (2) Identify reasonably foreseeable external risks including cyber attacks, malware, phishing, social engineering, data theft, DDoS attacks, ransomware, zero-day exploits, supply chain compromise, physical theft, natural disasters; (3) Evaluate likelihood (probability) of each identified threat - how likely to occur based on threat frequency data, industry trends, institution's exposure level, attacker motivation and capability, preventive controls effectiveness; (4) Evaluate potential impact (damage/harm) of each threat - confidentiality impact (unauthorized disclosure), integrity impact (unauthorized modification), availability impact (loss of access/service), financial impact, reputational impact, regulatory impact, customer harm; (5) Assess confidentiality, integrity, availability (CIA triad) of customer information and systems - what information, systems, and processes require highest protection; (6) Evaluate sufficiency of existing safeguards and controls - are current technical, administrative, physical controls adequate to mitigate risk to acceptable level; identify gaps and weaknesses; (7) Categorize and prioritize risks based on likelihood × impact calculation - critical, high, medium, low severity; (8) Document how identified risks will be treated - mitigate (implement controls), accept (tolerate), transfer (insurance, outsource), avoid (eliminate activity); (9) Result drives entire security program - safeguard selection and implementation prioritized by risk. Assessment should follow structured framework (NIST Risk Management Framework, NIST SP 800-30, ISO 27005, ISO 31000) using consistent evaluation criteria and scoring methodology. Assessment must cover all systems and processes handling customer information including those managed by third parties/service providers.","All financial institutions under Safeguards Rule; conducted by or under oversight of Qualified Individual (CISO/Security Officer);
