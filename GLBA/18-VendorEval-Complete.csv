glba_vendor_001,Vendor Assessment and Due Diligence,Procedure,Pre-engagement evaluation of third-party service providers to determine risk level and GLBA compliance capability. Includes vendor questionnaire, security review, financial stability assessment, and risk-based tiering. Documented and retained per examination requirements.,"Per GLBA Safeguards Rule and Interagency Guidance on Third-Party Relationships, institutions must implement policies and procedures to ensure third-party service providers with access to customer information maintain safeguards and comply with GLBA requirements. Vendor assessment is foundational control; must occur before engagement; risk assessment determines vendor tier and ongoing oversight requirements. Assessment components: vendor identification and questionnaire; security questionnaire covering encryption, access controls, incident response; financial stability review; background checks; regulatory examination history; customer references. Vendor questionnaire addresses: GLBA awareness; data handling procedures; information security program; access controls; encryption practices; backup and recovery; incident response plan; business continuity; employee training; third-party sub-vendor management; audit procedures; compliance history. Risk assessment determines vendor tier: Tier 1 (Low): limited customer data access, non-sensitive data, secure environment, strong controls; Tier 2 (Medium): moderate data access, some sensitive data, standard controls; Tier 3 (High): extensive customer data access, highly sensitive data, critical functions, extensive oversight required; Tier 4 (Critical): essential vendor, critical functions, third-party data handling, heightened oversight. Assessment documentation includes: vendor name, address, contact information; services provided; customer data access; risk assessment score; tier assignment; contract recommendations; monitoring plan. Retention: retain assessment documentation; maintain updated records; reassess every 2-3 years; update for significant changes.","All institutions using third-party service providers; any vendor with access to customer information; applies to all institution sizes; mandatory for compliance; includes cloud service providers, IT vendors, payroll processors, backup vendors, disaster recovery, business intelligence, marketing service providers","Chief Compliance Officer for assessment policy; Procurement department for vendor selection and questionnaire; IT Security for security assessment; Finance for financial review; Vendor Manager for ongoing relationship; Legal counsel for contract review","GLBA Safeguards Rule Section 314; Interagency Guidance on Third-Party Relationships (Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC, NCUA, 2013); GLBA Service Provider expectations; Examination procedures for vendor management; State banking regulator guidance on vendor assessment","Mandatory control; required before vendor engagement; subject to examination focus; assessment quality directly affects institution liability; poor assessment results in enforcement action if vendor breaches","Vendor Assessment Process: Step 1 - Vendor Identification: identify need for vendor; determine services required; customer data scope; Step 2 - Preliminary Screening: check regulatory history; financial stability; industry reputation; references. Step 3 - Security Questionnaire: detailed questionnaire on information security program; encryption standards; access controls; multi-factor authentication; vulnerability management; incident response; business continuity; employee training; third-party management; audit procedures; certifications held (ISO 27001, SOC 2, etc.). Step 4 - On-Site Assessment (if applicable): for high-risk or critical vendors; review security controls; interview key personnel; test access controls; assess environment. Step 5 - Risk Assessment: evaluate inherent risk (data sensitivity, access scope, criticality); assess control strength; determine risk tier; document scoring. Step 6 - Contract Negotiation: include GLBA compliance requirements; data handling procedures; information security standards; incident notification requirements; termination and data return procedures; audit rights; indemnification; insurance requirements; liability limits. Step 7 - Documentation and Approval: document assessment; obtain approvals (Compliance, Risk, Legal); store in vendor management system; communicate tier and requirements to vendor. Vendor Assessment Factors: Data Sensitivity: access to SSN highest risk; financial account numbers high risk; payment card data high risk; health information sensitive; non-sensitive data lowest risk. Scope of Data Access: number of customer records accessed; portion of customer base affected; entire database versus subset. Criticality to Operations: essential vendor critical functions (disaster recovery, business continuity); high-priority vendor important but replaceable; low-priority vendor non-critical. Vendor Size and Stability: large established vendor lower risk; small vendor or startup higher risk; financial stability assessment important; multi-year financial statements review. Security Maturity: comprehensive information security program lower risk; limited or no program higher risk; certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001) indicate maturity; compliance with standards. Regulatory Status: vendor subject to regulation (bank, broker) lower risk; unregulated vendor higher risk; prior enforcement actions indicate concern; regulatory examination history relevant. Prior Breach History: no prior breaches preferred; history of breaches indicates higher risk; incidents in similar environments concerning; vendor response to breach important. Customer References: check references from other financial institutions; inquire about reliability, performance, security practices; incident history with other customers. Sub-Vendor Management: vendor's management of their own vendors important; understanding of their sub-vendors required; ensuring sub-vendor compliance.

Risk Tiering Decision: Tier 1 (Low Risk) - Limited customer data, non-sensitive, strong controls, established vendor, no breach history, can rely on standard contract terms and periodic review. Tier 2 (Medium Risk) - Moderate data access, some sensitive data, good controls, established vendor, can use standard oversight with annual certification or review. Tier 3 (High Risk) - Extensive customer data access, sensitive data (SSN, account numbers), critical functions or high-risk environment, require annual audit, detailed contract requirements, heightened monitoring. Tier 4 (Critical) - Essential vendor, critical functions, extensive data access, highest sensitivity, require pre-engagement audit, detailed contract with extensive GLBA requirements, quarterly monitoring, right to audit anytime, dedicated relationship manager. Initial Assessment Documentation: create vendor file with assessment summary; store assessment questionnaire responses; maintain scoring documentation; record risk tier decision; document management approval; establish contract file with all vendor agreements. Reassessment Schedule: annual assessment for Tier 3 and 4 vendors; biennial for Tier 2; triennial for Tier 1; additional assessment if significant changes occur; changes warranting reassessment: change in ownership, merger or acquisition, significant service expansion, reported security incidents, examination findings, materially increased data access. Update Procedures: when vendor information changes; when control environment changes; when services expand or contract; when incidents occur; document changes and update risk tier if necessary. Examination Focus: examiners assess vendor assessment program: do assessments exist for all vendors; are assessments adequate; is documentation complete; are risk tiers appropriately assigned; are contractual requirements GLBA-compliant; is monitoring adequate per risk tier.
