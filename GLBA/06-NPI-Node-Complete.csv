glba_npi_002,Customer Information,Data Category,"Information collected by financial institutions about customers in ongoing relationships, subject to heightened privacy protections under GLBA Regulation P compared to one-time consumer transactions. Includes broader scope of NPI and extends protections throughout customer relationship.","GLBA distinguishes between consumer and customer for application of privacy protections. Consumer is an individual who obtains or has obtained financial product or service from institution for personal, family, household purposes. Customer is consumer with whom institution has ongoing relationship. Customer information includes all NPI relating to customer and includes information about customer in institution's possession and information about customer in possession of service providers. Customer information relationships are continuous for duration of relationship and may extend beyond relationship for certain purposes. Customer information receives higher protection level under Financial Privacy Rule because ongoing relationship typically involves more detailed financial information. Customer relationships trigger: annual privacy notice requirement (unless FAST Act exemption applies), ongoing opt-out rights for information sharing, annual reminder of opt-out availability, customer access to institution's privacy policy, ongoing data protection obligations. Customer information use restricted to purposes authorized by customer or permitted by GLBA. Sharing limitations apply to customer information - institution cannot share with non-affiliates without customer opt-out right. Service provider relationships with customers require written contracts with GLBA safeguard requirements. Customer information retention policies must document how long information retained and destruction procedures.","All financial institutions with ongoing customer relationships; Applies to individuals (consumers) who establish accounts or relationships;

When financial institution obtains health information in connection with financial products/services, that information qualifies as NPI under GLBA requiring Safeguards Rule protection. Health information also often triggers HIPAA Privacy Rule if institution acts as Business Associate to healthcare provider or health plan. GLBA and HIPAA have different scopes but may overlap. GLBA Safeguards Rule applies to health information held by financial institution regardless of HIPAA applicability. HIPAA Privacy Rule applies if institution is Business Associate of HIPAA-covered entity. When both apply, must comply with stricter requirement on each issue. Common scenario: bank acting as Business Associate to health plan or healthcare provider - must comply with both GLBA and HIPAA.
