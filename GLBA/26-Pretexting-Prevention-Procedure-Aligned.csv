glba_pretext_001,"Pretexting Risk Identification and Scenario Analysis","Procedure","Methodology for identifying pretexting risks across channels, products, and user groups and mapping them to specific GLBA safeguards.","Pretexting—obtaining customer information under false pretenses—is explicitly targeted by GLBA, which requires institutions to design and maintain safeguards to detect and prevent such schemes. A formal risk-identification process examines all customer-interaction channels, including branches, call centers, online and mobile banking support, email, chat, and social media, to determine how fraudsters might impersonate customers, employees, or regulators. The institution documents realistic scenarios, such as callers posing as customers who have forgotten login credentials, fraudsters pretending to be law-enforcement officers, or individuals calling on behalf of elderly relatives. Each scenario is evaluated for likelihood and potential impact, and mapped to controls such as authentication procedures, scripts, and escalation requirements.","All customer-facing and internal support functions that handle or can influence access to nonpublic personal information, including branch staff, contact centers, back-office operations, IT help desks, and relationship managers.","Enterprise Risk Management for overall methodology; Fraud, AML, and Information Security teams for threat intelligence and scenario design; business-line leaders for validating channel-specific risks; Compliance for ensuring alignment with GLBA pretexting provisions.","GLBA pretexting-prevention provisions; Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards; FFIEC guidance on authentication in an Internet banking environment; relevant OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, NCUA, and FTC communications about social engineering and impersonation schemes.","Foundational element of a pretexting-prevention framework. Examiners expect institutions to understand where and how pretexting could occur and to design controls accordingly.","Channel Inventory: list all external and internal channels where individuals can request information or changes to accounts, including phone, video calls, secure and insecure email, chat, social media, branch visits, and written correspondence. Threat Modeling: for each channel, identify how an attacker could impersonate a customer, employee, law-enforcement officer, or vendor to obtain information or trigger actions such as password resets or address changes. Scenario Development: create detailed scenarios that reflect current fraud trends, such as SIM-swap related calls, deepfake voice impersonation, or phishing-driven credential theft followed by social-engineering calls. Control Mapping: map scenarios to required controls such as multi-factor authentication, callback procedures, knowledge-based questions, and mandatory verification scripts. Prioritization: rank scenarios by potential customer harm and likelihood; focus initial design and testing on the highest-risk combinations of channel, product, and customer segment. Review Cycle: revisit scenarios regularly using fresh intelligence from incidents, law-enforcement bulletins, and industry information-sharing groups; update documentation and control design accordingly." 
glba_pretext_002,"Customer-Interaction Scripts and Authentication Procedures","Procedure","Standardized scripts and multi-layered authentication procedures for handling customer contacts in ways that prevent and detect pretexting.","Even the best-designed policies fail if staff do not have practical, usable procedures for authenticating callers and visitors and recognizing red flags. Pretexting-prevention programs must therefore translate high-level requirements into specific scripts and authentication flows for different interaction types. These flows combine something the customer knows (such as PINs or answers to security questions), something they have (such as one-time codes sent to registered devices), and sometimes behavioral indicators or out-of-band verification. Scripts also instruct staff what to do when callers resist authentication, provide partial or suspicious information, or claim special status (for example, being law-enforcement, executives, or relatives in distress).", "All roles that interact with customers or handle customer-information requests, including call-center agents, branch staff, private bankers, collections staff, IT help-desk personnel, and certain vendors providing customer support services.","Customer Service leadership and Training for script design and roll-out; Information Security and Fraud for specifying authentication requirements and red flags; Compliance for ensuring scripts align with GLBA and other regulatory obligations; Vendor Management for ensuring outsourced call centers follow identical procedures.","GLBA pretexting provisions; Safeguards Rule expectations for authentication and access controls; FFIEC guidance on call-center authentication and online banking security; internal policies on customer authentication and social-engineering response.","Directly observable control area. Examiners and auditors may review scripts, listen to recorded calls, and test whether staff follow procedures when confronted with pretexting attempts.","Authentication Flow Design: define tiered authentication methods depending on the risk of the request (for example, viewing balances versus changing contact information or initiating wires); ensure high-risk actions always require multi-factor or out-of-band verification. Script Content: develop clear scripts that walk staff through greeting, identity verification, explanation of why questions are necessary, and handling of incomplete or suspicious answers; include language for politely refusing to proceed without adequate verification. Red-Flag Recognition: embed prompts for red flags such as callers who rush or pressure staff, claim not to have any identification information, insist on bypassing normal procedures, or name-drop executives or regulators. Escalation Paths: require staff to escalate certain patterns to supervisors or fraud teams, such as repeated failed authentication attempts, requests combined with unusual account activity, or calls that match known scam profiles. Positive Customer Experience: train staff to explain authentication requirements in customer-friendly terms, emphasizing protection of the customer’s accounts and identity, while firmly adhering to controls. Monitoring and Coaching: use call monitoring, quality-assurance reviews, and mystery-shopping to evaluate adherence to scripts and authentication flows; provide targeted coaching and, where needed, disciplinary action for non-compliance." 
glba_pretext_003,"Training, Testing, and Continuous Improvement for Pretexting Prevention","Procedure","Ongoing training, testing, and feedback-loop mechanisms to ensure staff can recognize and resist pretexting attempts and that controls evolve with emerging threats.","Because pretexting and social-engineering tactics evolve quickly, GLBA programs must treat staff awareness and skill as a living control rather than a one-time initiative. Training must go beyond generic security awareness to include realistic, channel-specific examples and opportunities to practice responses. Testing, such as simulated pretexting calls or phishing campaigns, provides empirical evidence of control effectiveness and identifies where additional training or process changes are needed. Feedback loops from real incidents, near-misses, and law-enforcement or industry alerts ensure that training content and procedures remain current.","All employees and contractors with access to customer information or capable of influencing access, with deeper, scenario-based training for high-risk roles such as call-center agents, branch staff, and operations personnel handling account changes.","Information Security Awareness or Training teams for curriculum design; Fraud and AML teams for scenario design and threat intelligence; HR and Business-Line Management for enforcing participation; Internal Audit and Compliance for independent assessment of program effectiveness.","GLBA Safeguards Rule expectations for training and awareness; pretexting-prevention provisions; FFIEC guidance on security awareness; industry best practices on social-engineering testing.","Key indicator of an institution’s security culture. Examiners review training materials, participation rates, test results, and how lessons learned feed back into controls.","Curriculum Design: develop role-based modules that cover what pretexting is, why it matters under GLBA, real examples from the institution or industry, and the specific authentication and escalation procedures relevant to each role. Delivery Channels: combine e-learning, classroom or virtual sessions, job aids, and quick-reference guides; ensure new hires receive training before they are granted access to customer information. Simulated Testing: run periodic simulated pretexting or social-engineering exercises, such as fake calls or emails, to measure how often staff follow procedures; provide immediate feedback and targeted remedial training. Metrics and Reporting: track participation, test performance, incident trends, and repeat failures; report to senior management, risk committees, and the board as part of GLBA training and security reporting. Incident Feedback: incorporate lessons from actual pretexting incidents or near-misses into updated scripts, training content, and controls; use case studies in training to make risks concrete. Vendor and Third-Party Coverage: ensure that outsourced call centers and other service providers with customer-contact responsibilities receive equivalent training and are included in testing programs; address shortcomings through contractual remedies and remediation plans."
