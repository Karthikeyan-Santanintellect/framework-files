glba_con_001,Consumer,Individual,"Individual who obtains or has obtained a financial product or service from a financial institution for personal, family, or household purposes, either as single transaction (consumer) or continuing relationship (customer). Base category under GLBA Privacy Rule with specific limited rights distinct from ongoing customer relationship.","Under GLBA Regulation P Sections 1016.3 and 313.3, consumer is defined as individual who obtains or has obtained financial product or service from financial institution primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. Consumers can be categorized into two groups by transaction type: (1) Transactional Consumers - one-time or non-recurring transactions (person cashing check at check-cashing company, person making wire transfer, person obtaining title insurance, person getting tax preparation one-time service), and (2) Prospective Customers - individuals in process of obtaining financial product who may become customers (person completing loan application, person shopping for insurance, person inquiring about services). Consumer status depends on nature of product/service (personal use, not business). All consumers are covered by GLBA privacy protections (Regulation P and Safeguards Rule). However, if consumer establishes continuing relationship (account opened, loan issued, policy purchased), consumer becomes customer with enhanced rights. Critical distinction: consumers receive privacy notice only if institution shares information with non-affiliated third parties (subject to exceptions); consumers have opt-out rights only if sharing occurs (no automatic annual notice). Therefore, institution may not send annual privacy notice to consumer unless sharing with non-affiliates.","Individuals obtaining financial products/services for personal use; financial institutions determining privacy notice and opt-out requirements; compliance and privacy teams classifying individuals; all financial institutions under GLBA; applies to consumer-facing operations (deposits, lending, insurance, investment, payment services); applies to prospective customers in application/inquiry stage;

glba_con_002,Customer,Individual,"Individual with established continuing relationship with financial institution for financial product or service for personal, family, or household purposes. Enhanced category under GLBA Privacy Rule with comprehensive privacy rights including annual privacy notices, broad opt-out rights, and ongoing protections throughout relationship duration. Distinct from transactional consumer with fewer rights.","Under GLBA Regulation P Sections 1016.4 and 313.4, customer is consumer (individual obtaining financial product/service for personal, family, household purposes) who has continuing relationship with financial institution. Continuing relationship established through various product/service arrangements: deposit or investment account (checking, savings, money market, investment accounts); credit or debit accounts (credit cards, lines of credit, overdraft protection); loan (mortgage, auto, student, personal, home equity); insurance policy (any type, regardless of duration - even short-term travel insurance); ongoing advisory services (investment advisory, financial planning, tax advisory); payment services (continuing payment arrangements); rental of safe deposit box. Key distinction: ALL customers are consumers, but NOT all consumers are customers. Customer status requires reasonable determination by institution that continuing relationship exists (not just initial transaction). Once customer relationship established, consumer obtains enhanced privacy rights (annual notice requirement, ongoing opt-out rights) and remains subject to obligations throughout relationship duration. Upon relationship termination (account closed, loan paid off, policy cancelled), customer reverts to consumer status and enhanced rights terminate.","Financial institutions with ongoing customer relationships;

glba_con_003,Business Entity,Individual,"Business organization (corporation, partnership, LLC, sole proprietorship, trust, nonprofit, government entity) distinguished from individual consumer/customer. Generally NOT covered by GLBA Privacy Rule if obtaining financial products/services for business purposes; separate business privacy rules may apply.","Under GLBA Regulation P Sections 1016.3 and 313.3, definitions of consumer and customer apply to individuals (natural persons) obtaining financial products or services for personal, family, or household purposes. Business entities (corporations, partnerships, LLCs, sole proprietorships operating as businesses, nonprofits, trusts, government entities) obtaining financial products or services for business or commercial purposes are generally NOT considered consumers under GLBA Privacy Rule. Sole proprietors present special case: if sole proprietor obtains financial product (e.g., business checking account, business loan, business insurance) in their personal capacity for business purposes, generally NOT a GLBA consumer; however, if sole proprietor has personal accounts (personal checking, personal savings), those ARE consumer accounts. Key: determination depends on stated purpose (business vs. personal) and nature of product/service. Business entities are subject to different privacy rules: bank secrecy rules, tax reporting requirements, limited privacy rights compared to individuals. Some state privacy laws (CCPA, VCDPA) apply to business entities in different ways than individuals.
