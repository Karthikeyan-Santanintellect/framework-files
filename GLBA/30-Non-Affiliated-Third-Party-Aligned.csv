na_tp_001,"Non-Affiliated Third-Party Definition and Categorization","Definition","Definition and categorization framework for non-affiliated third parties under GLBA, distinguishing them from affiliates and service providers.","Under GLBA, a non-affiliated third party is any person or entity that is not an affiliate of the financial institution, meaning it does not control, is not controlled by, and is not under common control with the institution. This category includes many service providers, joint-marketing partners, and external vendors. Properly categorizing counterparties as affiliates, non-affiliated third parties, or service providers is essential because it determines how privacy notices, opt-outs, and contractual safeguard requirements apply. A structured taxonomy helps ensure consistent treatment across business units and avoids misclassification that could lead to privacy-rule violations.","All relationships involving sharing of customer information outside the corporate family, including marketing partners, data processors, cloud providers, collection agencies, consultants, and joint-venture participants.","Privacy and Compliance for GLBA interpretation and classification rules; Vendor Management for maintaining the third-party inventory; Legal for defining control and affiliate relationships; Business Owners for initial categorization and ongoing validation.","GLBA Sections 502 and 509 (definitions and information-sharing provisions); Regulation P (privacy of consumer financial information); Interagency Guidelines on Information Security; third-party risk-management guidance from federal banking regulators.","Foundational to applying GLBA privacy and safeguard rules correctly to third-party relationships.","Relationship Inventory: maintain a comprehensive inventory of counterparties with access to or potential access to nonpublic personal information; record ownership structure, control relationships, and purpose of data sharing. Affiliate Versus Non-Affiliate: use clear tests based on ownership percentage, common control, and governance to distinguish affiliates from non-affiliated entities; document borderline cases and legal opinions. Service Provider Versus Marketing Partner: distinguish entities that process information solely on the institution’s behalf from those that receive information for their own marketing or other purposes; apply different privacy and contractual requirements accordingly. Category Codes: assign standard categories such as ‘core processor,’ ‘cloud hosting,’ ‘collections,’ ‘analytics vendor,’ ‘joint marketer,’ and ‘data aggregator’ to support risk assessment and reporting. Periodic Reassessment: review classifications during vendor due diligence, renewal, and major change events (such as mergers or divestitures) to ensure they remain accurate." 
na_tp_002,"Privacy Notice and Opt-Out Implications for Non-Affiliated Third Parties","Procedure","Mapping of non-affiliated third-party categories to GLBA privacy-notice content, opt-out rights, and exceptions.","Sharing information with non-affiliated third parties is a central focus of GLBA’s Privacy Rule. Institutions must disclose in their privacy notices whether and how they share consumer information with such parties and, in many cases, must give consumers the right to opt out of certain types of sharing. At the same time, GLBA provides exceptions for sharing necessary to service or process transactions, prevent fraud, or comply with law. A structured mapping from third-party categories to notice content and opt-out requirements ensures that privacy disclosures are accurate and that opt-out mechanisms are properly implemented and enforced.","All consumer-facing products and services where customer information may be shared with non-affiliated third parties, including retail banking, credit cards, mortgage lending, auto finance, student lending, and investment products.","Privacy Officer and Compliance for notice content and opt-out design; Marketing for joint-marketing arrangements; IT and Operations for implementing opt-outs in systems; Vendor Management for enforcing contractual restrictions.","GLBA Sections 502–503; Regulation P privacy-notice and opt-out provisions; FTC and CFPB guidance on unfair or deceptive practices in privacy disclosures; state privacy laws where applicable.","Essential for aligning what the institution actually does with what its privacy notices say and with consumer rights.","Category-to-Rule Matrix: build and maintain a matrix that maps each non-affiliated third-party category to the applicable GLBA rule: sharing allowed without opt-out (for example, processing transactions or preventing fraud), sharing requiring opt-out (for example, certain marketing and joint-marketing uses), or sharing prohibited absent specific consent. Notice Content: ensure privacy notices accurately describe each category of non-affiliated third party with whom information is shared, the purposes of sharing, and whether opt-out applies; avoid vague or misleading descriptions. Opt-Out Mechanics: link opt-out rights to specific system flags and vendor feeds so that once a consumer opts out, systems automatically suppress non-exempt sharing with relevant third parties; include mail, phone, and online opt-out channels where appropriate. Exception Handling: document and explain GLBA exceptions such as servicing accounts, responding to court orders, and fraud prevention; ensure that staff understand when sharing is allowed notwithstanding opt-outs. Testing and Monitoring: periodically test whether opt-out flags are honored in outbound data feeds, marketing lists, and vendor integrations; remediate any leakage promptly." 
na_tp_003,"Contractual and Oversight Requirements for Non-Affiliated Third Parties","Procedure","Contractual clauses and oversight practices applied to non-affiliated third parties to satisfy GLBA safeguard and privacy obligations.","Non-affiliated third parties that receive nonpublic personal information must be bound by contracts that require confidentiality, appropriate safeguards, and limitations on use and disclosure. Institutions must also monitor these parties to verify ongoing compliance. For service providers, GLBA explicitly requires that institutions take reasonable steps to select and retain capable providers and to require them by contract to implement and maintain appropriate safeguards. For marketing and other non-servicing third parties, additional limitations on secondary use and redisclosure may be necessary. Oversight includes periodic risk assessments, review of independent assurance reports, incident monitoring, and enforcement actions where obligations are not met.","All non-affiliated third parties that receive or process customer information, including processors, cloud providers, marketing partners, analytics vendors, and collection agencies.","Vendor Management and Third-Party Risk teams for due diligence and ongoing monitoring; Legal and Procurement for contract language; Information Security for security requirements and assessments; Privacy and Compliance for use and disclosure limitations.","GLBA Safeguards Rule service-provider provisions; Regulation P limits on reuse and redisclosure; FFIEC outsourcing and third-party risk-management guidance; OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, and NCUA bulletins on vendor management.","Critical to demonstrating that the institution exercises appropriate control over customer information once it leaves its direct systems.","Contractual Safeguards: require non-affiliated third parties to maintain an information-security program with administrative, technical, and physical controls commensurate with the sensitivity of data; specify encryption, access-control, and incident-response expectations; impose confidentiality obligations. Use and Redisclosure Limits: restrict third parties from using information for any purpose other than performing services or as permitted by GLBA; prohibit sale or further sharing of data without explicit authorization and compliance review; incorporate flow-down requirements to subcontractors. Due Diligence and Risk Scoring: assess security posture, financial condition, regulatory history, and operational capabilities before engagement; assign risk ratings that drive monitoring intensity. Ongoing Monitoring: review SOC reports or equivalent, conduct periodic assessments or questionnaires, track incidents, and ensure timely remediation of findings; verify that opt-outs and data-use limitations are honored in practice. Termination and Offboarding: ensure contracts require secure return or destruction of customer data at termination; verify execution through certifications or audits; remove network and system access and monitor for residual data exposures."
