glba_law_001,"Law Enforcement Exception to GLBA Privacy Rule","Definition","Permissive exception allowing disclosure of nonpublic personal information to law-enforcement and government authorities under specified legal processes without providing an opt-out.","The GLBA Privacy Rule contains several exceptions that allow financial institutions to disclose nonpublic personal information to law-enforcement agencies and other government authorities without giving consumers an opportunity to opt out and, in some cases, without additional notice. Typical scenarios include responding to properly issued subpoenas, court orders, or search warrants; complying with formal requests from supervisory agencies; reporting suspected criminal activity, fraud, or terrorist financing; and cooperating with investigations that institutions are required by law to support. Disclosures under these exceptions must be limited to what is lawful and necessary, documented appropriately, and consistent with information-security and records-management policies. Staff must understand that the exception is permissive rather than blanket and that legal review is often needed before releasing information.","All GLBA-covered financial institutions and their affiliates that receive information requests from law-enforcement, prosecutors, regulatory agencies, or other government bodies seeking customer or transactional data.","Legal or General Counsel for review of legal authority and scope; Compliance and BSA or AML teams for suspicious-activity reporting and liaison with authorities; Records Management and Operations for locating and producing records; Information Security for secure transmission and logging.","GLBA Privacy Rule exceptions for law-enforcement and regulatory disclosures; Bank Secrecy Act and implementing regulations; Right to Financial Privacy Act for certain federal requests to depository institutions; state criminal-procedure and privacy laws; applicable rules of civil and criminal procedure.","Essential part of a compliant privacy and law-enforcement cooperation framework. Examiners review how institutions interpret and apply GLBA exceptions, protect customer privacy while meeting legal obligations, and document responses to government requests.","Scope of Exception: identify which GLBA provisions permit disclosure without opt-out, including compliance with laws and legal process, fraud prevention, and security of records; distinguish these from discretionary disclosures that may still raise privacy concerns. Policy Framework: maintain a written policy on responding to legal process and government requests that spells out approval levels, documentation standards, and escalation paths. Request Intake: centralize receipt of subpoenas, warrants, national-security letters, and regulatory requests in a legal-process unit; verify authenticity, jurisdiction, and any non-disclosure provisions; log each request with unique identifiers and deadlines. Legal Review and Minimization: require legal or trained compliance staff to review scope, identify overbroad demands, and negotiate narrowing or protective orders when appropriate; ensure that only information specifically requested and lawfully required is produced. Customer Notice: evaluate whether customer notice is required or permitted under the Right to Financial Privacy Act or state law and whether any gag orders apply; use standardized templates and tracking where notice is provided. Secure Production: transmit records via secure portals, encrypted media, or hand delivery; maintain detailed inventories of what was shared, with whom, and under which legal authority. Retention and Audit Trail: retain copies of legal process, internal approvals, correspondence, and production logs for defined periods so that the institution can demonstrate compliance in later audits, litigation, or examinations. Training: provide periodic training to branch and contact-center staff instructing them not to release information directly to law-enforcement but to route all requests through the designated legal-process channel." 
glba_law_002,"Suspicious Activity Reporting and Information Sharing","Procedure","Procedures for filing suspicious activity reports, cooperating with law-enforcement, and sharing information under safe-harbor provisions while protecting GLBA privacy interests.","Under the Bank Secrecy Act and related regulations, many GLBA-covered institutions must file Suspicious Activity Reports when they detect known or suspected criminal violations, money laundering, terrorist financing, or other suspicious patterns. SAR content and existence are strictly confidential, but underlying transactional and account information may be shared with law-enforcement as authorized by law. GLBA's privacy framework expressly accommodates BSA obligations, and safe-harbor provisions protect institutions that share information in good faith under applicable statutes. A sound program defines criteria for SAR decision-making, internal escalation channels, coordination with legal and law-enforcement, and procedures for responding to follow-up requests such as subpoenas or Section 314 information requests.","Depository institutions, credit unions, broker-dealers, money-services businesses, and other financial institutions subject to BSA or AML requirements, as well as their GLBA-covered affiliates involved in suspicious-activity detection and reporting.","BSA or AML Officer and financial-intelligence unit for investigations and SAR filing; Legal for privilege, confidentiality, and law-enforcement liaison; Compliance for policy maintenance; Operations and front-line staff for alerting and escalation; Information Technology for monitoring systems and data analytics.","Bank Secrecy Act and implementing regulations; FinCEN SAR regulations and guidance; USA PATRIOT Act information-sharing provisions including Sections 314(a) and 314(b); GLBA Privacy Rule exceptions for fraud prevention and security; FFIEC BSA or AML Examination Manual.","Mandatory for covered institutions. Supervisors evaluate not only whether SARs are filed when required but also whether institutions protect SAR confidentiality and align BSA or AML practices with GLBA privacy obligations.","Detection and Escalation: implement automated monitoring and manual referral channels for suspicious behavior such as structuring, unusual wire patterns, rapid movement of funds, and identity-theft patterns; ensure that front-line employees know how and where to escalate concerns. Investigation: centralize case management in an AML or financial-intelligence unit; gather account history, KYC information, prior alerts, and external data; analyze whether activity is explainable or suspicious; document rationales. SAR Decision and Filing: apply documented thresholds and typologies to decide when a SAR is required; obtain necessary approvals; file within regulatory timeframes with high-quality narratives that will be useful to law-enforcement. Confidentiality Controls: segregate SAR records, restrict access to designated personnel, and integrate SAR confidentiality reminders into policies and training; coordinate with Legal on handling any external legal demands that might implicate SAR content. Information Sharing with Authorities: respond promptly to Section 314(a) requests; if participating in 314(b) voluntary information sharing, ensure registration and internal procedures are in place; maintain logs of all information shared under safe-harbor frameworks. Governance and Reporting: provide periodic reports to senior management and the board on SAR trends, law-enforcement feedback, and emerging risks, including privacy and data-protection dimensions." 
glba_law_003,"Handling Subpoenas, Warrants, and Government Requests","Procedure","Standardized process for receiving, reviewing, and responding to legal demands for customer or employee information while balancing GLBA privacy with legal obligations.","Financial institutions routinely receive subpoenas, search warrants, regulatory examination requests, and informal inquiries seeking customer or transactional data. A disciplined response process protects customer privacy, ensures compliance with GLBA and other confidentiality laws, and reduces litigation and enforcement risk. Key elements include centralized intake, legal review for validity and scope, clear criteria for when to object or narrow requests, standardized production methods, and comprehensive logging. Staff must distinguish between legally binding process such as court-issued subpoenas or warrants and informal requests that do not compel disclosure. Where multiple legal regimes apply, such as GLBA, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, state privacy laws, or foreign data-protection rules, institutions may need to reconcile conflicting obligations or seek protective orders.","All business units that may receive legal demands, including branches, call centers, operations centers, corporate offices, fraud and collections teams, and human-resources departments.","General Counsel or a centralized legal-process unit for intake and coordination; Compliance for policy design and training; Records Management and Information Technology for data search, extraction, and preservation; Business units as custodians and subject-matter experts.","GLBA Privacy Rule exceptions; Right to Financial Privacy Act for certain federal government requests; federal and state rules of civil and criminal procedure; law-enforcement and regulatory enabling statutes; applicable foreign privacy laws for cross-border data transfers.","Core control for any regulated financial institution. Examiners and courts may scrutinize how institutions handle government requests, especially where privacy, over-production, or customer-notice issues arise.","Centralized Intake and Triage: require that all legal demands, including subpoenas, warrants, summonses, and regulatory letters, be forwarded immediately to a designated legal-process unit; prohibit ad hoc responses by front-line staff; assign a unique identifier to each matter and track deadlines. Validity and Scope Review: confirm jurisdiction, proper service, and facial validity; determine whether the institution or a specific affiliate is actually the target; assess scope for overbreadth, privilege, or undue burden; consult outside counsel where appropriate. Decision and Negotiation: decide whether to comply, move to quash, or negotiate narrowing; weigh privacy risks, operational impact, and legal exposure; document the final decision and rationale. Search, Collection, and Preservation: define standardized search protocols for core systems such as deposit, lending, card, online banking, HR, and email; involve custodians as needed; implement legal holds to prevent deletion of potentially relevant data. Review and Redaction: review responsive records for privilege, confidential third-party information, or especially sensitive data; redact where permitted; maintain clear records of what was withheld or redacted. Secure Production: provide records through secure electronic transfer, encrypted media, or in-person delivery; label productions with matter identifiers; retain copies of everything produced. Customer Communication: determine whether customers must or may be notified in light of RFPA, gag orders, or state-law requirements; use standardized templates and track notice events. Quality Assurance and Training: periodically sample matters to confirm adherence to procedures; update playbooks based on lessons learned, new case law, or regulatory guidance; train staff annually on recognizing and routing legal demands."
