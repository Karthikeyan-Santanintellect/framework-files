glba_acl_001,"Access Control Governance and Role Design","Procedure","Framework for defining, approving, and governing access rights to systems and data that contain GLBA-covered customer information.","Access-control lists (ACLs) are only effective when they are built on a clear governance model that defines who may access what, for which business purposes, and with what approval and segregation-of-duties safeguards. Institutions must establish role-based access models that map business roles to specific entitlements, distinguish between privileged and non-privileged access, and require formal approval workflows for exceptions. Governance includes maintaining an authoritative inventory of systems and data stores that contain customer information, defining data owners and access approvers for each, and ensuring that changes to ACLs follow documented change-control processes. This governance layer directly supports GLBA safeguard requirements to limit access to those with a legitimate need.","All applications, databases, file shares, and infrastructure components that store or process nonpublic personal information, including customer-facing systems and internal support tools.","Chief Information Security Officer and Information Security Governance teams for policy and standards; Application and Data Owners for role definitions and approvals; Human Resources for role catalog and joiner-mover-leaver workflows; IT Operations and Identity Management for technical implementation.","GLBA Safeguards Rule; Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards; FFIEC IT and Information Security booklets; internal access-control and least-privilege policies.","Foundational control that underpins technical and administrative safeguards. Examiners review how institutions define and manage access rights as part of GLBA and broader IT-risk assessments.","System and Data Inventory: maintain an up-to-date catalog of systems, applications, and repositories that contain customer information; designate data or application owners and document their responsibilities for approving access and reviewing entitlements. Role-Based Access Models: design business roles with associated entitlements that reflect actual job functions; minimize use of generic or catch-all roles; document segregation-of-duties conflicts and compensating controls. Approval Workflows: require documented approvals from data or application owners and managers for all new access or privilege changes; implement electronic workflows within identity-management tools where possible. Change Control: treat modifications to ACLs as change-controlled activities, with testing for high-risk changes; log all changes and retain records for audit. Exception Handling: clearly define how and when access may be granted outside standard roles (for example, emergency access or break-glass accounts); require time limits, enhanced logging, and post-incident review. Documentation and Standards: publish access-control standards, naming conventions, and role definitions; ensure they are available to auditors, regulators, and internal stakeholders." 
glba_acl_002,"User Provisioning, De-Provisioning, and Access Reviews","Procedure","Operational processes for creating, modifying, and removing user access, and for conducting periodic access-certification reviews to keep ACLs accurate and least-privilege.","Even well-designed access-control lists become stale and risky if user provisioning and de-provisioning are not timely and controlled. Institutions must tightly integrate HR events such as hiring, transfers, and terminations with identity and access management (IAM) processes. Provisioning should be driven by role and require formal approval; transfers must trigger review and adjustment of entitlements; and terminations must result in immediate revocation of access, including remote access and privileged accounts. Periodic access reviews, or certifications, require managers and data owners to verify that existing entitlements remain appropriate. These reviews are especially important for high-risk systems and privileged accounts.","All employees, contractors, and third-party users with access to systems or data containing nonpublic personal information.","Identity and Access Management team for technical provisioning; Human Resources for authoritative employment data; Managers and Data Owners for approval and periodic certification; Information Security and Internal Audit for oversight and testing.","GLBA Safeguards Rule; Interagency Guidelines; FFIEC guidance on access management; internal HR, security, and IAM policies.","Critical day-to-day control that prevents accumulation of excessive access and reduces insider-risk and account-compromise impact. Regulators and auditors routinely sample provisioning records and access reviews.","Joiner Process: provision accounts only after receipt of an approved request that references a defined role; verify that requested access aligns with job responsibilities; avoid cloning access from peers without review. Mover Process: on transfers or role changes, automatically trigger reevaluation of access; remove entitlements that are no longer needed; adjust roles to reflect new responsibilities; ensure no orphaned high-risk privileges remain. Leaver Process: upon termination or contract end, immediately disable network, application, VPN, and remote-access accounts; collect or disable physical badges and tokens; document completion; coordinate with HR to detect unannounced departures. Temporary and Third-Party Access: tightly control temporary, vendor, or consultant access with clear end dates, scope limitations, and enhanced monitoring; avoid sharing generic accounts. Access Certification: run periodic (for example, quarterly or semi-annual) reviews where managers and data owners attest to the appropriateness of access for their staff; require justification for retaining unusual or high-risk entitlements; track completion and remediation of revocations. Evidence and Logging: retain records of requests, approvals, and removals; log administrative actions; make evidence readily available for audits and examinations." 
glba_acl_003,"Privileged Access Management and Monitoring","Procedure","Controls for managing and monitoring privileged accounts and highly sensitive entitlements within access-control lists to protect GLBA-regulated data.","Privileged accounts, such as system administrators, database administrators, and security operators, have the ability to bypass or modify controls and therefore present elevated risk to GLBA-regulated customer information. Institutions must implement dedicated privileged access management (PAM) processes to limit the number of privileged accounts, strictly control who may use them, and monitor activity in detail. PAM controls include vaulting administrative credentials, requiring check-out and time-bound use, enforcing multi-factor authentication, recording privileged sessions, and conducting targeted reviews of logs. Clear separation of duties and independent oversight reduce the risk of abuse or undetected compromise.","All privileged users and accounts on systems that store, process, or secure nonpublic personal information, including core banking platforms, databases, file servers, security tools, and identity-management systems.","Information Security and Infrastructure teams for implementing PAM technologies and processes; Application Owners and DBAs for system-specific controls; Internal Audit and Compliance for oversight and testing.","GLBA Safeguards Rule; FFIEC guidance on privileged user management; internal policies on least-privilege and segregation of duties; broader industry standards on PAM.","High-impact control area. Examiners often ask how privileged access is controlled and monitored on systems containing customer information.","Account Minimization: maintain an inventory of privileged accounts; eliminate unnecessary or dormant accounts; prefer named, individual accounts over shared ones; restrict assignment of privileged roles to personnel with a demonstrated need. Credential Management: store administrative credentials in a secure vault; require check-out with documented justification; rotate passwords frequently and upon role changes; prohibit hard-coded credentials in scripts where possible. Strong Authentication: require multi-factor authentication for all privileged access, including remote administration and access to security tools; restrict privileged access from unmanaged or untrusted devices. Session Monitoring and Logging: record privileged sessions for high-risk systems; log administrative commands, configuration changes, and access to sensitive data; protect logs from tampering; retain them for periods aligned with risk and regulatory expectations. Review and Oversight: conduct targeted, periodic reviews of privileged activity; investigate anomalies such as after-hours access, unusual commands, or access from unexpected locations; document findings and remediation. Integration with Incident Response: ensure that incident-response plans explicitly consider privileged-account compromise scenarios; rehearse rapid credential-rotation and access-containment steps during exercises."
