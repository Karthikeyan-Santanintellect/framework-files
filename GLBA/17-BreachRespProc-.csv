glba_breachresp_001,Breach Discovery and Assessment,Procedure,"Initial procedures upon discovery of suspected security incident involving customer information. Includes confirmation of breach, scope assessment, affected customer determination, and triggering of formal incident response plan. Discovery date determines 30-day FTC notification deadline.","Per GLBA Safeguards Rule Element 8 (16 CFR 314.4(e)) and Breach Notification Rule (16 CFR 314.5), upon discovery of suspected security incident/breach, institution must initiate formal assessment. Discovery defined as: first reasonable awareness of incident; not investigation completion; triggers 30-day FTC notification deadline (for breaches affecting 500+ individuals). Breach discovery triggers automatic: incident response activation; investigation initiation; scope assessment; management notification; potential FTC/state notification planning. Discovery documentation: record discovery date and time; record who discovered; record initial observations; record initial assessment of severity.","All financial institutions; all incident types involving customer information; all locations; all data types; applies to: employee discovery, customer report, law enforcement notification, vendor notification, threat intelligence indication","Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) upon notification; Incident Commander for response coordination; Chief Compliance Officer for notification requirements; Chief Risk Officer for board reporting; General Counsel for legal assessment; Law Enforcement Liaison if applicable","GLBA Safeguards Rule Element 8 (16 CFR 314.4(e)) incident response; Breach Notification Rule (16 CFR 314.5) discovery and assessment; Interagency Guidance on Response Programs; FTC guidance on breach notification timing; State breach notification laws","Mandatory element of incident response plan; discovery date critical for 30-day deadline; assessment must begin immediately upon discovery; proper assessment prevents delayed notification and regulatory violations","Discovery Scenarios: Employee Discovery: employee discovers compromised system, unauthorized access, malware, suspicious activity, missing media, unauthorized deletion; employee reports to manager, IT Help Desk, Security, Compliance; Customer Report: customer reports unauthorized transaction, account compromise, suspicious activity, suspected identity theft; escalated to Fraud Department, IT Security, Compliance; Internal Monitoring Alert: automated systems alert suspicious access pattern, failed login attempts, data exfiltration, malware detection; reviewed by Security Operations, IT staff, incident team; Law Enforcement Notification: law enforcement discovers fraud, identity theft affecting customers, cyberattack, criminal activity; notifies institution; triggers investigation; Vendor Notification: service provider reports breach affecting vendor systems and customer data; institution evaluates scope of institution's customer information affected; breach assessment; Threat Intelligence: institution receives threat intelligence indicating data exposed, institution affected; investigates applicability to customers; Media Report: breach affecting institution identified in media; institution verifies, investigates, escalates. Initial Assessment: Incident Confirmation: first priority is confirming incident occurred - unauthorized access confirmed, system compromise confirmed, data breach confirmed, versus false alarm or suspicious activity not confirmed; Severity Classification: assign initial severity level (low, medium, high, critical) based on preliminary assessment of scope, data type, number potentially affected, system impact; Initial Scope Estimate: estimate number of individuals affected, type of data involved, data exposure (accessed versus exfiltrated), time period of exposure; Management Notification: notify CISO, Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Risk Officer, General Counsel, CEO (if high/critical severity); initial briefing on situation; Incident Response Plan Activation: formal incident response initiated; incident team convened; response procedures begun; Documentation: record discovery - date, time, who discovered, initial findings, initial assessment, actions taken, people notified. Breach versus Non-Breach Assessment: Key Questions: Was customer information accessed? (Yes = breach likely; No = incident but not necessarily breach); Was customer information disclosed to unauthorized party? (Yes = breach; No = lower risk); Did access create substantial risk of identity theft or fraud? (Yes = likely breach; No = assess further); Confidentiality Impact: unauthorized access to social security numbers, financial account numbers, payment card data with CVV = high risk of identity theft/fraud; names/addresses without financial data = lower risk; types of data: sensitive personal identifiers (SSN) = major breach concern; financial data (account numbers, balances) = major breach concern; payment card data = major breach concern; health information = sensitive, likely breach; health insurance info = sensitive; non-sensitive data = lower breach risk; Disclosure: data stolen/exfiltrated = breach; data accessed but not taken = lower breach risk; data destroyed (ransomware) = assess if data exposed to attackers before encryption; data modified (integrity) = less breach concern unless sensitive; data accessed but not viewed = still breach if unauthorized access. Scope Assessment: Number of Individuals: affected by breach = count, estimated versus confirmed, states represented; Timeframe: period of exposure = date first compromise to date discovery; 1 day = lower scope; months = higher scope. Data Categories: determine which data types exposed - name, address, phone, email; SSN; financial account numbers; payment card numbers; health information; driver's license; passport; religious/ethnic information; insurance information; age; gender; Sensitivity Analysis: combine number of individuals + data type sensitivity = risk assessment; example: 100,000 SSNs = very high risk; 100,000 email addresses = lower risk. Investigation Scope: determine which systems affected, which customers affected, which staff involved, which time period, investigation needed to reduce estimates to confirmed numbers. Affected Individual Determination: Customer Database Review: review customer information accessed by compromised account; determine who accessed; what data viewed; which customers affected; System Access Log Review: review who had access to compromised system, what data accessed, what timeframe, system access controls, audit trails; Data Exfiltration Analysis: if data stolen, determine what data taken, how much, file sizes, backup media stolen, document exfiltration; Media Recovery: if media/device stolen - determine if data encrypted; if encrypted = lower risk; if unencrypted = high risk. Breach Cause Preliminary Assessment: hacking (external intrusion); insider threat (employee/contractor unauthorized access); lost/stolen device; misconfiguration; malware; ransomware; third-party vendor breach; accidental disclosure; phishing/social engineering leading to credential compromise. Incident Classification Update: based on assessment, classify incident - Level 1 (Low): few customers affected, non-sensitive data, suspicious activity investigated, no confirmed breach; Level 2 (Medium): multiple customers affected, some sensitive data, confirmed unauthorized access, breach assessment ongoing; Level 3 (High): significant number affected, sensitive data (SSN/account numbers), confirmed breach, investigation ongoing; Level 4 (Critical): 500+ individuals affected, highly sensitive data, extensive breach, multi-agency coordination needed. Risk of Identity Theft/Fraud Assessment: GLBA breach notification rule requires 'substantial risk of identity theft or fraud'; assessment factors: data type (SSN + financial data = high risk); number affected (more = higher risk); evidence of misuse (any fraud evidence = confirms risk); time exposed (longer = higher risk); controls in place (encryption = reduces risk); perpetrator knowledge (who stole, why). Presumption Approach: many institutions presume substantial risk exists if SSN exposed, financial account number exposed, payment card data exposed, other sensitive personal identifiers exposed; this presumption supports notification requirement. Forensic Investigation Planning: scope of forensic investigation - determine what systems need examination; determine if external forensics firm needed; preserve evidence; establish chain of custody; timeline for preliminary findings; timeline for complete findings. Containment Decisions: immediate containment needed - disable compromised accounts; revoke access; block attackers; patch vulnerabilities; isolate affected systems; change credentials. Regulatory Notification Planning: assess notification requirements - FTC if 500+ individuals affected (must notify within 30 days); state attorney general if 500+ state residents affected; state consumer notification for affected individuals (varies by state, from any to 500+); FTC Notification Planning: if 500+ affected, plan - complete FTC Security Event Reporting Form within 30 days; identify information needed (affected number, data types, incident description, states); prepare summary for form; State Notification Planning: review state breach notification laws where customers reside; determine whether notification required (some states every individual, some 500+); notice timing (typically 60 days); notice method (mail, email, or public notice if 500+ state residents); notice content requirements; Customer Communication Planning: determine what customers will be notified; notice method (mail, email, phone); notice content (incident description, data exposed, steps to take, institution contact, credit monitoring offer if applicable); timing of notification (goal: as soon as possible, typically 60 days); executive approval needed. Credit Monitoring Decisions: assess whether credit monitoring should be offered - offered if SSN exposed, financial account number exposed, payment card data exposed; credit monitoring duration (typically 12-24 months); fraud alert; credit freeze assistance. Law Enforcement Notification: assess whether to notify law enforcement - notify if criminal activity suspected, identity theft likely, fraud occurring, large-scale breach; FBI for national scope; local law enforcement for local crimes; Secret Service for payment card fraud; state attorney general if required by law. Documentation of Discovery: create incident file including discovery information (date, time, discoverer); initial assessment (severity, scope estimate); initial action (team notification, plan activation); documented in incident tracking system, incident response files, board/executive briefing. Board Notification: notify board or board committee if high/critical severity; initial briefing on situation; ongoing updates; disclosure of regulatory notification needs. Media Relations Assessment: assess whether media notification needed - major breaches likely to be public; prepare statement; manage communications; control narrative."

Forensics Firm Selection - if external firm needed, select reputable firm with GLBA/financial services experience; chain of custody procedures; reporting quality; cost negotiation. Engagement Agreement - contract with forensic firm includes scope of work, timeline, deliverables, chain of custody procedures, confidentiality, law enforcement coordination if needed. Preliminary Investigation - IT staff begins initial investigation: access logs review, system snapshots, preservation of evidence, preliminary scope estimate. Forensic Procedures: Evidence Preservation - preserve all potential evidence: don't modify systems, preserve file system state, preserve memory dumps, preserve network logs, chain of custody maintained, evidence documented. System Imaging - forensic image of compromised system(s): bit-for-bit copy, preserves deleted files, preserves evidence, multiple copies (one for analysis, one for preservation, one for backup). Log Analysis - review system logs: Windows/Unix logs, application logs, database logs, network logs, firewall logs, IDS/IPS logs, email logs, access logs, authentication logs, data access logs. Timeline Reconstruction - establish timeline: first evidence of compromise, lateral movement, data access, data exfiltration, time of discovery, time of containment. File System Analysis - deleted file recovery, file access dates, creation dates, modification dates, content analysis, file locations, evidence of deletion attempts. Memory Forensics - if volatile memory preserved: analyze for malware in memory, running processes, network connections, credentials in memory, attacker tools, commands executed. Database Analysis - database access logs, queries executed, data exported, administrative actions, unauthorized access patterns, exfiltration evidence, data modification. Email Analysis - email logs, forwarding rules, sent items, external emails, suspicious attachments, phishing indicators. Network Analysis - network traffic analysis, packet captures, suspicious connections, data exfiltration indicators, command and control communications, lateral movement evidence. Interview Procedures: Interview Subjects - employees with access to compromised systems, system administrators, recent system changes, terminated employees (if relevant), suspicious activity reporters. Interview Questions - when did you last access system, what functions did you perform, did you notice anything unusual, do you know of any unauthorized access, are your credentials secure, are you aware of any security incidents. Interview Documentation - document who interviewed, date, questions asked, responses, credibility assessment. Findings and Analysis: Preliminary Findings - initial forensic findings: compromise confirmed, scope preliminary estimate, cause preliminary assessment, timeline preliminary. Detailed Findings - comprehensive forensic report including executive summary, detailed technical analysis, timeline, scope assessment, cause analysis, perpetrator identification, evidence preservation. Scope Determination - final assessment: number of individuals affected (confirmed or estimated), data types accessed, time period of exposure, geographic scope (states affected). Cause Analysis - determine how attacker gained access (hacking, insider, vendor breach, misconfiguration, malware), root cause, contributing factors, vulnerability exploited. Perpetrator Assessment - internal perpetrator (employee, contractor) versus external attacker; if known attacker, provide information to law enforcement; attribution if possible. Remediation Recommendations - forensic findings include remediation recommendations, controls to prevent recurrence, vulnerable system updates, configuration changes. Notification Requirements - forensic findings determine FTC notification requirement (if 500+ affected), state notification requirements, notice content (data types, description of incident). Investigation Report: Comprehensive Report - detailed forensic report documenting investigation scope, procedures, findings, evidence, analysis, conclusions, remediation recommendations. Executive Summary - non-technical summary for board, executives, legal counsel, regulatory agencies.
