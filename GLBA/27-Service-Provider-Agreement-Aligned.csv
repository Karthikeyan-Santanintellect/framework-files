glba_spa_001,"GLBA Service Provider Agreement Requirements","Procedure","Core contractual requirements that must appear in agreements with third-party service providers that access or handle nonpublic personal information.","GLBA requires financial institutions to ensure that their service providers maintain appropriate safeguards to protect customer information. This obligation is typically implemented through service-provider agreements that impose explicit privacy, security, and compliance requirements. Contracts must clearly define the scope of services, specify which categories of nonpublic personal information will be shared or accessed, and obligate the provider to implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards consistent with the institution's GLBA program. Agreements also address incident-notification timelines, cooperation with investigations, audit and assessment rights, subcontractor controls, data-retention and destruction, and restrictions on use and disclosure of data. Well-structured agreements help manage legal, operational, and reputational risk while demonstrating compliance to regulators.","All third-party service providers, affiliates acting as service providers, and sub-service providers that receive, process, store, or have access to GLBA-covered nonpublic personal information.","Legal and Procurement for contract drafting and negotiation; Information Security for specifying security controls; Privacy and Compliance for GLBA requirements; Business Owners for defining service scope; Vendor Management for ongoing oversight.","GLBA Safeguards Rule and service-provider provisions; Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards; FFIEC guidance on outsourcing technology services; OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, and NCUA third-party risk-management bulletins; internal vendor-management policies.","Mandatory control whenever outsourcing functions involving customer information. Examiners frequently review contract language as part of vendor-management and GLBA-safeguards assessments.","Scope of Services and Data: define in detail the services to be provided and the specific types of customer information involved; prohibit use of the data for any purposes other than performing contracted services or as required by law. Safeguard Obligations: require the provider to implement information-security controls that meet or exceed the institution's standards, including access control, encryption, secure development practices, vulnerability management, logging and monitoring, incident response, and business continuity. Compliance Representations: require the provider to represent and warrant compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including GLBA, data-breach and privacy laws, and sector-specific rules; require notice of any material regulatory actions involving the provider. Subcontractor Controls: prohibit subcontracting without prior written approval; require flow-down of all GLBA and security obligations to subcontractors; hold the primary provider responsible for subcontractor performance. Data Location and Cross-Border Transfers: specify where data may be stored or processed; require disclosure and approval of offshore locations; address cross-border data-transfer mechanisms where applicable. Change Management: require the provider to notify the institution of material changes to infrastructure, ownership, or control that could affect risk; allow the institution to reassess and, if necessary, terminate the relationship." 
glba_spa_002,"Security, Incident Response, and Audit Clauses","Procedure","Detailed security, incident-handling, and audit-related provisions that operationalize GLBA safeguard expectations in service-provider agreements.","Beyond high-level obligations, GLBA-aligned service-provider agreements must include specific, testable requirements for security controls, incident response, and the right to assess compliance. Security clauses typically mandate baseline controls such as encryption, access control, secure configuration, and regular testing. Incident-response clauses define what constitutes a security incident or breach, specify how quickly providers must notify the institution, and require cooperation in investigation and remediation. Audit clauses give the institution the right to receive independent assessment reports, such as SOC 2, and, where necessary, to conduct on-site assessments or technical testing. These provisions together allow institutions to verify that outsourced operations meet GLBA expectations on an ongoing basis.","All service providers and key subcontractors whose failures could compromise confidentiality, integrity, or availability of GLBA-covered customer information.","Information Security for defining control baselines and assessment techniques; Legal and Procurement for embedding clauses; Vendor Management for scheduling and tracking assessments; Internal Audit for independent validation.","GLBA Safeguards Rule; FFIEC IT Examination Handbook for Outsourcing Technology Services; regulatory bulletins on third-party risk; industry standards such as SOC 2, ISO 27001, and NIST-based control frameworks.","Core of technical-risk management within third-party contracts. Regulators expect to see clear, actionable language on security controls, notification timeframes, and audit mechanisms.","Security Baselines: require implementation of specific control families, including user access management, network security, endpoint protection, vulnerability management, secure software development, and configuration management; mandate periodic security-awareness training for provider staff. Incident Definition and Notification: define what constitutes a security incident and a data breach; set notification timeframes (often immediate awareness notification with a maximum outer bound such as 24 or 72 hours); require progress updates and final incident reports. Investigation and Remediation: obligate the provider to cooperate with the institution's investigations, including providing logs, forensic images, and personnel access; require timely remediation of identified weaknesses and written corrective-action plans. Evidence and Reporting: require delivery of independent assurance reports, such as SOC 2 Type II or ISO certifications, on a recurring basis; specify how exceptions and findings must be communicated and remediated. Audit and Testing Rights: reserve the institution's right, directly or via third parties, to perform on-site assessments, technical testing, or process reviews where risk justifies it; define reasonable scheduling, scope, and confidentiality protections. Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery: require tested continuity and recovery plans that meet the institution's recovery-time and recovery-point objectives for critical services; require periodic test results and remediation of identified gaps." 
glba_spa_003,"Data Retention, Destruction, and Termination Provisions","Procedure","Contractual terms governing how service providers retain, return, and destroy GLBA-covered data during and after the relationship, and how termination is managed from a risk perspective.","Service-provider agreements complete the GLBA control lifecycle by specifying what happens to customer information throughout and at the end of the engagement. Data-retention clauses align provider practices with the institution's records-retention schedule and legal-hold requirements. Termination and transition clauses require providers to return or securely destroy all customer information, certify destruction, and support migration to replacement providers without undue disruption. These provisions reduce the risk that data persists in uncontrolled environments or that critical services fail during offboarding.","All third-party providers and relevant subcontractors that store or process GLBA-regulated customer data, particularly cloud and data-processing providers.","Records Management and Legal for retention and legal-hold requirements; Information Security for destruction standards; Vendor Management and Business Owners for transition planning; Procurement for negotiating termination rights.","GLBA Safeguards Rule and disposal provisions; state secure-disposal and data-breach statutes; records-retention regulations; internal records-management and information-security policies.","Important for ensuring that GLBA obligations persist through the entire vendor lifecycle, including offboarding. Auditors and regulators often ask how institutions ensure data is removed from third-party environments when relationships end.","Retention Alignment: require providers to retain customer information only as long as necessary to fulfill contractual obligations or comply with law; align with the institution's retention schedules and legal holds; prohibit indefinite retention for provider convenience. Secure Destruction: mandate specific destruction methods appropriate to the medium (for example, shredding or pulping for paper, secure wipe or destruction for electronic media); require destruction of backups and cached copies where feasible; require written certification of destruction. Data Return and Format: specify that, upon request or termination, the provider must return customer information in agreed-upon, usable formats within defined timeframes; require transfer methods that are secure and verified. Termination Assistance: require reasonable transition assistance to migrate services to a new provider or bring them in-house, including knowledge transfer, documentation, and parallel-run support; define fees if appropriate. Post-Termination Access: ensure that, after termination and data return or destruction, provider personnel no longer have logical or physical access to customer information; require removal of credentials and access paths. Verification and Audit: allow the institution to verify retention and destruction practices through documentation, certifications, and, where risk justifies it, direct assessments; address non-compliance through remediation requirements and, if necessary, contractual remedies or termination for cause."
