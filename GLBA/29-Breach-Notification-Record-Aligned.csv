bn_rec_001,"Breach Notification Case Record","Record","Standardized record structure used to document each GLBA-relevant security incident or breach, including scope, data elements affected, affected populations, and decisions on notification and remediation.","A Breach Notification Case Record is the authoritative file for any incident that may trigger GLBA, Safeguards Rule, or state data-breach notification obligations. It consolidates technical, legal, and business information about the event so the institution can demonstrate a reasoned, well-documented decision-making process. The record typically captures incident description and timeline, systems and data involved, categories of nonpublic personal information affected, number and types of individuals impacted, cause and containment actions, legal and regulatory analysis, breach determination, notification scope and content, remediation measures, and post-incident lessons learned. Maintaining consistent, complete records is essential for audits, regulatory examinations, and potential litigation.","All GLBA-covered institutions handling customer data, including banks, credit unions, non-bank lenders, servicers, payment processors, and service providers acting as data custodians.","Information Security or Incident Response team for technical incident details; Legal and Compliance for breach-analysis, notification, and regulatory aspects; Business-Line Owners for customer impact; Risk Management for residual-risk evaluation; Internal Audit for independent review.","GLBA Safeguards Rule; FTC Safeguards and Breach Notification Rule; Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards; state data-breach notification laws; FFIEC guidance on incident response.","Core artifact required for demonstrating that incidents affecting GLBA-regulated data were analyzed and handled in a consistent, risk-based, and legally sound manner.","Record Structure: standardize fields across incidents, including incident ID, discovery date and time, detection source, affected business unit, incident owner, and status. Data Classification: document what types of nonpublic personal information were potentially exposed (for example, account numbers with or without access credentials, Social Security numbers, driver’s-license numbers, authentication credentials, contact information); distinguish between encrypted and unencrypted data. Scope and Impact: estimate the number of affected records and individuals, geographic distribution, customer segment (consumer, small business, commercial), and whether any high-risk populations (such as elderly or minors) are involved. Timeline: log key milestones including detection, containment, initial assessment, escalation to senior management, legal-review completion, notification decisions, and remediation completion. Legal and Regulatory Analysis: capture legal counsel’s assessment of whether the incident meets applicable breach definitions, considering GLBA, state law, and sectoral regulations; record rationale for deciding whether notification is required, optional, or not appropriate. Notification Plan: if notification is required or chosen, document the affected jurisdictions, notification methods (mail, email, website, media), notification templates used, contents of notices, and delivery timelines. Remediation Activities: record specific remediation steps such as credential resets, system patches, configuration changes, enhanced monitoring, and customer support measures (including identity-protection services if offered). Coordination and Communications: document internal and external communications, including notifications to regulators, law-enforcement, payment networks, and major clients or partners; attach copies of significant communications. Lessons Learned: after closure, summarize root cause, control gaps, what worked, and what will be improved; link case record to risk-register updates, policy changes, and training improvements. Evidence Management: ensure attachments such as forensic reports, legal opinions, customer communications, and board updates are stored and indexed with the record." 
bn_rec_002,"Regulatory and Customer Notification Tracking","Procedure","Processes and fields within breach records that track regulatory and customer notifications, including dates, content versions, and confirmations.","To comply with GLBA and the FTC’s Safeguards Rule breach-notification provisions, as well as state data-breach statutes, institutions must accurately track whom they notified, when, how, and using what content. Within each Breach Notification Record, a dedicated notification-tracking section logs all required and voluntary notifications. This includes federal and state regulators, law-enforcement, consumer reporting agencies, affected individuals, and in some cases business customers or partners. The tracking function must support attestation that all deadlines were met and that notification content met legal standards and internal quality requirements.","All incidents that reach the threshold of a reportable or notifiable event under GLBA, Safeguards, or state-breach laws, and any incident where the institution elects to notify customers as a precautionary or goodwill measure.","Legal and Compliance for determining notification obligations and approving content; Incident Response and Information Security for triggering notifications; Customer Communications and Operations for delivery; Regulatory Relations for regulator interactions.","FTC Safeguards Rule breach-notification requirements; GLBA and Interagency incident-response guidance; state data-breach notification laws; sector-specific rules (for example, NYDFS cybersecurity regulation where applicable).","Key to proving timely, complete notification and avoiding enforcement actions or class-action exposure for missed or mishandled notices.","Regulator Notifications: record which regulators were notified (for example, FTC, banking regulators, state attorneys general, state insurance departments), the statutory or regulatory basis for notification, the method (portal, email, letter), and the date and time sent; attach copies or screenshots of submissions. Consumer Notifications: track the number of notices sent by channel (mail, email, SMS, in-app), batches and send dates, and any undeliverable or bounced communications; record any substitute notice (such as website postings or media announcements) and the criteria used. Content Versioning: link each set of notifications to the approved template version, including legal review sign-off and any jurisdiction-specific modifications; maintain a library of approved templates and track changes over time. Deadlines and SLAs: compute and monitor statutory deadlines from discovery or determination dates; use the record to check compliance with internal and legal service-level agreements; highlight upcoming deadlines for management attention. Third-Party Involvement: where service providers perform notifications on the institution’s behalf, capture their reports, proofs of sending, and exception lists; verify fulfillment against agreed scope and timing. Consumer-Response Handling: log inbound calls, complaints, or inquiries specifically referencing the breach; track key themes and escalation cases; link to customer-care scripts and FAQs used." 
bn_rec_003,"Post-Incident Review, Metrics, and Board Reporting","Procedure","Use of breach-notification records to support post-incident reviews, metrics, and reporting to senior management and the board under GLBA governance expectations.","Breach-notification records are not only historical files but also inputs to continuous improvement and governance reporting. Institutions aggregate data from individual records to show trends in incident frequency, severity, root-cause categories, notification timeliness, and customer impact. These metrics inform risk appetite discussions, resource allocation, and board-level oversight. Post-incident review processes examine whether risk assessments, controls, and training were adequate; whether GLBA safeguard requirements were met; and what corrective actions are needed. Strong reporting reinforces a culture of accountability and transparency around information-security and privacy risks.","All GLBA-covered institutions with board and senior-management oversight responsibilities for information-security and privacy risk.","Chief Information Security Officer and Incident Response leadership for analytics; Enterprise Risk Management for risk reporting; Compliance and Privacy Officers for GLBA alignment; Board or Risk Committee secretariat for agenda and materials.","GLBA governance expectations and Interagency Guidelines on board oversight; FTC and banking-agency enforcement precedents; FFIEC cybersecurity and incident-response guidance; internal risk-management frameworks.","Demonstrates to regulators and stakeholders that incidents are being used to drive control enhancements and that GLBA-related risks receive sustained executive attention.","Post-Incident Review Workflow: require structured reviews for material incidents within a defined timeframe (for example, 30–60 days after closure); use standard agendas covering root cause, control effectiveness, detection and response timelines, customer impact, and regulatory interactions. Metrics Definition: define key metrics such as number of GLBA-related incidents per quarter, proportion deemed reportable breaches, average time to detect and contain, average time to notify, numbers of customers affected by severity tier, and financial and operational impacts. Trend Analysis: use breach records to identify recurring failure modes (for example, misconfigured cloud storage, phishing, third-party failures) and to track whether corrective actions reduce incident frequency or severity over time. Board and Executive Reporting: prepare concise dashboards and narratives summarizing recent incidents, trend metrics, major remediation programs, and any enforcement or litigation exposure; ensure GLBA-specific angles (safeguards compliance and breach-handling quality) are highlighted. Integration with Risk and Audit: feed results into enterprise risk registers, internal audit planning, and model or control-validation cycles; track management action items and due dates. External Benchmarking: where feasible, compare incident patterns and response metrics to industry benchmarks or regulatory expectations, adjusting targets and investment levels accordingly."
